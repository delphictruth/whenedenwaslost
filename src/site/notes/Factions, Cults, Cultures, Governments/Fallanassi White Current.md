- Also known as *The Force*, *Adepts of the White Current*

# Fallanassi White Current
The White Current is the Fallanassi interpretation of the Force, and is often used in the creation of illusions and concealment rather than for anger, protection, healing, aggression, or any other reason. The White Current is uniquely different from other aspects and schools of thought in that the Current is the immersion of oneself in the actual flows and ripples within the Force, rather than in the Force as a whole.

Their practice focuses primarily on the mind, spirit, and body, and how they form a single individual. Because of this, Adepts of the White Current are capable of manipulating powers and abilities that directly pertain to the mind and how the Current interacts with body and spirit, but they rarely have control over physical manifestations of the Force such as [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Telekinesis]].

Skilled Adepts are capable of sensing the flowing currents nearly constantly and they are able to feel how they flow around other beings. This makes it extremely hard to sneak up on an Adept, even with cloaking technology. 

An unique ability of the Adepts is [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force immersion\|Force immersion]], which allows them to sheild and hide themselves and their surroundings from vision and electronic sensors.
