# Chiss
Chiss individuals, nearly always females, who are born to be Force-sensitive, are born with the ability of [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Precognition\|Third Sight]], otherwise known as Precognition. Because of this, they are used by the Chiss to navigate and pilot their ships through the Unknown Regions, as well as for finding and mapping temporary hyperlanes. Such Chiss navigators are known as *ozyly-esehembo.*
