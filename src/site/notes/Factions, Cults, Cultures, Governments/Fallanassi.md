# Fallanassi
The Fallanassi is a religious order devoted to the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Fallanassi White Current\|White Current]], or their interpretation of the Force. It is mostly an all-female group, not unlike the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Witches of Dathomir\|Witches of Dathomir]], and they very rarely share their teachings with men. They are particularly strong with creating illusions and uniquely capable of [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force immersion\|Force immersion]], but they tend to lack skill in manipulating the physical world and in [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Telekinesis\|telekinetic]] abilities. They are pacifists with a strong focus on inner harmony and peace, but they also teach that authority is an illusion and that everyone should serve only their own desires.
