# Disciples of Ragnos 
The Disciples of Ragnos refers to the cult(s) that formed in honor of Dark Lord of the Sith [[Characters/Dark Lord Ragnos\|Maka Ragnos]], whose [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force ghosts\|Sith ghost]] still lived on in the [[Tomb of Maka Ragnos\|Tomb of Maka Ragnos]] in the [[Valley of the Dark Lords\|Valley of the Dark Lords]] on [[Navigational/Moraband\|Moraband]].

Centuries after his death, the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Disciples of Ragnos\|Disciples of Ragnos]] was dedicated to learning the ghost's teachings and to trying to bring him back to life. They spent several generations trying to find the [[Weaponry, Ships, Technology/Sceptor of Ragnos\|Sceptor of Ragnos]], the Sith Lord's lost sword, which was capable of siphoning Dark side energy and transferring it to individuals to make them Force sensitive. They intended to grow their numbers and try to use the Sceptor to solidify Ragnos's ghost. However, the group was destroyed before they could ever locate the Sceptor.

In 16 ABY, the Disciples began to form once more under the teachings of [[Characters/Disciple\|Disciple]], who spoke of Maka Ragnos's legacy and claimed to know where the Sceptor was located. [[Characters/Disciple\|Disciple]] was a survivor of the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Jen'jidai Cult\|Jen'jidai Cult]], which had a stronghold in the [[Temple of Pesegam\|Temple of Pesegam]] on [[Navigational/Moraband\|Korriban]], and it was said that they had discovered the truth of Maka Ragnos during their time on the planet, before the [[Battles, Major Events, Wars, Eras/Fall of the Jen'jidai\|Fall of the Jen'jidai]] in 9 ABY. 

In the year 17 ABY, before the Disciples were publicly known, [[Characters/Disciple\|Disciple]] learned that his former Lord [[Characters/Alban Draig\|Raegal Aurelius]] had a son. Determined to create a new Savior of the Jen'jidai, this time styled as a vessel for [[Characters/Dark Lord Ragnos\|Dark Lord Ragnos]], he arranged to have [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Bastille Rodarch Draig]] kidnapped and brought to him during the Festival of Stars. While the pirates never completed their mission, [[Characters/Disciple\|Disciple]]'s involvement was never exposed and the Disciples remained hidden for the time being. 

In 24 ABY, the Disciples officially revealed themselves to the galaxy, terrorizing planets and trying to recruit new followers. The [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]] entered its first official conflict period in tryig to stop them. The battle raged on, with the Disciples scoring a significant victory in the [[Battles, Major Events, Wars, Eras/Battle of the Valley of the Dark Lords\|Battle of the Valley of the Dark Lords]] towards the end of 25 ABY when Jedi Knight [[Characters/Kieran Crevan\|Kieran Crevan]] entered the [[Tomb of Maka Ragnos\|Tomb of Maka Ragnos]] and subsequently became a vessel for [[Characters/Dark Lord Ragnos\|Maka Ragnos]] himself. 

Shortly thereafter, the Disciples attacked the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Jedi Praxeum\|Jedi Praxeum]] directly, with [[Characters/Dark Lord Ragnos\|Maka Ragnos]] leading their forces through his vessel, [[Characters/Kieran Crevan\|Kieran Crevan]]. During the battle, Kieran was killed by Jedi Knight [[Characters/Chevalier Hellix\|Chevalier Hellix]], but not before Kieran killed his own former master, Jedi Knight [[Characters/Catherine Greatstorm\|Catherine Greatstorm]]. With his vessel destroyed and the [[Weaponry, Ships, Technology/Sceptor of Ragnos\|Sceptor of Ragnos]] claimed by the Jedi, Maka Ragnos was banished once more. The Disciples were finally defeated.
