# Path engine

Path engines are a type of specialized hyperdrive that provided incredibly fast hyperspace travel through unorthodox and otherwise inaccessible *Paths*. These Paths (otherwise known as *hyperpaths*) are special routes through hyperspace that do not exist in conventional navigation systems and are seemingly impossible to replicate. 

The Paths and Path engines were developed by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Nihil\|Nihil]] and used to terrorize the galaxy during the High Republic Era.
