### Weapons

#### Jedi Saber
[crystal] color hilt style attuned

#### Darksider Saber
 Vi did not yet have a JEDI SABER at the time of the Fall — her first DARKSIDER SABER is formed from the crystal of ALFRED'S JEDI SABER; she took and bled his crystal to form her original red blade, but later dismantled it, accidentally broke the crystal, and turned it into an unstable dagger-like SHOTO — her second set of weapons are two red SABER TONFAS devised from rare Qixoni crystals that boost the blades and her connection to the Force during use — Vi has also designed a LIGHTWHIP with two tendrils, formed by two different crystals acting to power each of the whip tendrils: one an Allya's Exile crystal, which makes that strand incredibly hot and dark red in tone, and one an Blackwing crystal, which creates a dark, smokey ash-black strand — she is known to try out interesting BLASTERS or other MELEE TYPE FORCE WEAPONS

## History & Plot Significance
Brief blurb.

Vi experiences fallout from the Fall of the Praxeum and other early trauma; she is particular vulnerable to the Dark Side and losing control given that she was still early in her training when she turned and has a looser grasp on herself — she does not know her parents; she was raised by a band of smuggler on Corellia and in fact believes that her last name, Cordelia, is derived from the plant as opposed to any parents; she was eventually discovered as Force sensitive at age 10 by Bastille and brought to the Praxeum
