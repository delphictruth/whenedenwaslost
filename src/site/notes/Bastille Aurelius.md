## History & Plot Significance
Bastille Aurelius is the legacy of two iconic families from the [[Meta/Beginnings#Galatic Civil War Era|Galactic Civil War]], and he has had an extremely chaotic life to show for it. He was primarily raised by his aunts, [[Talia Draig|Talia Draig]] and [[Malkyn Rodarch|Malkyn Rodarch]], and believed [[Malkyn Rodarch|Malkyn Rodarch]] to be his mother for the majority of his life. He was 15 when the scandal of him being the Sith [[Abel Draig|Raegal Aurelius]]'s son became public knowledge, and Bastille thought the truth explained the oddities of his life.

He has always been able to hear the Sith of the past in his thoughts, and seems to have a peculiar connection to the [[Force ghosts|Force ghosts]] who have haunted him all his life. His temperment reflected the chaos frequently as a child, and he was watched very closely by [[Dahlia Coutier|Dahlia Coutier]] at the [[Jedi Praxeum|Jedi Praxeum]] for fear that he was naturally inclined towards the Dark side. This suspicion grew among the other Knights and Padawans after his parentage was revealed, and most thought that something like the [[Fall of the Jedi Praxeum|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]] was inevitable. 

Ironically, when the [[Fall of the Jedi Praxeum|Fall]] finally came, Bastille was not at the heart of it. Instead, he took [[Roman Ange|Roman Ange]]'s place in order to spare the young Padawan and because everyone assumed that he had been the one to call down the Sith [[Darth Grimm|Darth Grimm]] in the first place. He planned to turn his exile into an opportunity, but was surprisingly joined by the majority of his [[Jedi Padawan Classes|Jedi Padawan Class]] in his defection. 

They later emerged as the [[Knights of Ren|Knights of Ren]] of the [[First Order|First Order]], whom many who had known them were able to connect to [[Jedi Padawan Classes|Jedi Padawan Class III]]. To the rest of the Galaxy, he became *Ani Ren*, personal Warlord of the [[Supreme Leader|Supreme Leader]].
