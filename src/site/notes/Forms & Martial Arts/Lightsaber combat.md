# Lightsaber combat
Lightsaber combat refers to several schools of martial arts specializing in (though not limited to) fighting with a lightsaber. It is sometimes more generally thought of as *Jedi combat*, with some forms or techniques relying solely on a practitioner's connection with the Force. 

Such fighting forms focus on compensating for or taking advantage of the unique attributes of lightsabers (such as the odd balance with all the weight in the hilt, the omni-directional cutting edge, and the limited reach).

*"A lightsaber—any weapon—only achieves worth in how it is wielded—in the effort, the struggle of the one who holds it."* — Former Jedi Master [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Kreia]]
## Basics
The [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] practiced several forms of lightsaber combat, but all training began with a thorough understanding of the basic maneuvers and various "zones" or body parts to target. Although many of the terminology used for these basics were developed by the Jedi, they have been adopted by other schools of martial arts or may be applied generally, outside of the context of formal training. 
### Body Target Zones
The basic Zones were developed for use with [[Forms & Martial Arts/Shii-Cho (I)\|Shii-Cho]], the first of the traditional forms, and refer to various "target zones" to direct an attack on an opponent. Attacks are described according to the zones that they target in this form, while parries refer to the zones that they are meant to shield or protect. For that reason, a certain zone's attack will generally be met with that same zone's parry position. 
#### Zone 1 (Head)
A *zone 1 attack* features a vertical chop at the head, with the goal of vertically bisecting an opponent. The corresponding *zone 1 parry* is a horizontal block with the blade held at head-height and angled across the body. 
#### Zone 2 (Right Arm and Side)
A *zone 2 attack* features a horizontal sideswipe, generally focused on a right-handed duelist's weapon arm. The corresponding *zone 2 parry* typically has the duelist holding the lightsaber at waist height with the blade extended upwards and vertically to deflect sideswipes.
#### Zone 3 (Left Arm and Side)
A *zone 3 attack* is the inverse of a *zone 2 attack*, featuring a horizontal sideswipe aimed at an opponent's left side. However, *zone 3 attacks* typically focus more on striking an opponent directly, as more often a duelist's weapon hand will be their right. The corresponding *zone 3 parry* is the same vertical block as that of the *zone 2 parry*
#### Zone 4 (Back)
A *zone 4 attack* focuses on the entire midsection and torso area, with a specific emphasis on targeting the back. A successful *zone 4 attack* is generally some combination of a *zone 2* or *zone 3* (horizontal sideswipes) and is nearly always fatal. The classic *zone 4 parry* is a drop parry position with the blade angled downwards, behind the duelist's back, though one variation on this parry has the hilt held behind the back at waist height, with the blade extended upwards. 
#### Zone 5 (Right Leg)
The *zone 5 attack* is a low side-sweep or slash angled towards an opponent's right leg. Depending on the opponent's own stance, this may mean targeting their dominant or back leg to disrupt their balance, or targeting their forward foot to compromise their movements. The *zone 5 parry* is a defensive drop parry with the hilt held at the waist. 
#### Zone 6 (Left Leg)
The inverse to *zone 5*, a *zone 6 attack* is a low side-sweep or slash angled towards an opponent's right leg. Depending on the opponent's own stance, this may mean targeting their dominant or back leg to disrupt their balance, or targeting their forward foot to compromise their movements. The *zone 6 parry* is a defensive drop parry with the hilt held at the waist. 
### Marks of Contact
Marks of Contact refer to the standard "marks" used across all of the seven traditional forms. These marks describe the objectives, maneuvers to use, and various outcomes that could arise out of lightsaber combat. The [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] taught the Marks in order to help narrow a duelist's focus to a few clear categories or goals, and sometimes used the marks as short-hand for various techniques.
#### Sun djem
The *sun djem* is the act of disarming an opponent, with the objective typically being not to physically harm the opponent. These attacks are typically aimed at the weapon in isolation, such as [[Forms & Martial Arts/Shii-Cho (I)\|Shii-Cho]]'s Disarming Slash.
#### Shiim
The *shiim* is a more minute wound made by the edge of a lightsaber's blade. This mark is exclusively a "technique" and not a specific zone on the body, as it can be applied anywhere on the body. 
#### Cho mai, cho sun, cho mok
This category of marks focus on amputation (and attempted amputation), but may be used to refer to strikes to those specific areas of the body. While *cho mok* refers to the amputation of an opponent's limb (arm or leg), *cho mai* is specifically the amputation of the weapon hand and *cho sun* is the amputation of the weapon arm. 
#### Shiak
The *shiak* is the act of stabbing an opponent. While this mark can technically be applied anywhere on the body, it traditionally refers to the chest and upper abdominal region. 
#### Sai cha
The *sai cha* is the decapitation of an opponent, but may be used to refer to other strikes at the throat or head. Typically a sideswipe at the side and the neck, these marks correspond with *zone 2* and *zone 3* attacks. The [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] traditionally taught that such marks should be reserved for droids or opponents who could not be defeated with non-lethal subduing attacks, as it is a more "dishonorable" mark in the eyes of the Jedi. 
#### Sai tok
The *sai tok* is the act of cutting an opponent in half, traditionally by separating their legs from their torso at the waist through a horizontal strike (*zone 2*, *zone 3*, *zone 4*), but it can also be performed vertically (*zone 1*).
#### Mou kei
The *mou kei* is an attack that dismembers an opponent through a circular motion of the lightsaber, aiming to strike all major limbs in one fluid motion. Successful *mou kei* marks are sometimes referred to as double, triple, or quad *cho mok* marks.

### Three Rings of Defense
The Three Rings of Defense are different levels of defense, generally imagined as rings surrounding a duelist at various distances. Certain defensive stances focus on different "rings" or ranges to defend attacks from. While there are standard stances associated with each ring, any defensive move or stance can technically be sorted into one of the rings. For that reason, the rings are less frequently taught by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] and generally only glancingly addressed. 

The standard rings are the *Outer Ring* (long-range attacks; wider and powerful swings but slower), *Middle Ring* (mid-range attacks; blocking quicker blows, such as blaster fire), and *Inner Ring* ("last line of defense," tight-quarter attacks; minimal blade movement held close to the body to defend dangerous and fatal attacks).
## Forms and Techniques
Historically, the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] has taught seven traditional forms of lightsaber combat. While Jedi were not required to strictly adhere to any one form, or any form at all, padawans were strongly encouraged to specialize in a form and were often required to train independently if they wished to practice alternative techniques.
