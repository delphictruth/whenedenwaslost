# Ataru
>The Way of the Hawk-Bat, The Aggression Form

An aggressive style, Form IV is fast-paced and effective against single opponents, though weaker in prolonged combat and confined spaces, or against blaster fire. Ataru is characterized by Force-assisted acrobatics, such as somersaults and leaping strikes, both for attack and defense. Another characteristic of the form is its fast strikes from multiple directions.

## Stances
The opening stance for Form IV is a balanced two-handed guard: holding the lightsaber vertically with both palms, either on the right or left side of the body.

## Common Maneuvers
One technique employed with greater effect by Ataru users is the *Hawk-Bat Swoop*. When utilized by Ataru practitioners, it is intended to allow a combatant to quickly strike their opponent without giving them a chance to react, and then escape before they have a chance to retaliate. 

Another move that Ataru users can use effectively is dubbed the *Saber Swarm*, where numerous short strikes are aimed at the adversary to force a defensive posture. Ataru wielders are able to execute this combination with particular skill.

Both the *Hawk-Bat Swoop* and the *Saber Swarm* are related to the *Falling Leaf* technique, and they gained in popularity during the New Sith Wars.
