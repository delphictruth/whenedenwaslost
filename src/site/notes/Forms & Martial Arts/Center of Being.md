# Center of Being
Center of Being is a stance used in [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber Combat\|lightsaber combat]], though it is also used for meditation. It was used by members of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], and later taught to students of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]]. 

Users hold their lightsaber horizontally, with the lightsaber hilt just below the chin. For combat purposes, it is generally used in combination with more passive and defensive forms. Some who fall deeply into this stance can unconsciously defend from even the most flowing random attacks and feigns. 

**Appearances**
* In Book XIII, [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] naturally uses an opening stance very close to the Center of Being when she uses a lightsaber for the first time. She relates it to using her quarter-staff, but it is also reflective of her innate inclination towards the more defensive style of combat, [[Forms & Martial Arts/Soresu (III)\|Soresu]].
