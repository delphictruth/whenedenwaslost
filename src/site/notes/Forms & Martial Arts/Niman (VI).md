# Niman
> The Way of the Rancor, The Moderation Form, The Diplomat's Form

This fighting style is a hybrid martial art created by effectively combining elements of the preceding lightsaber forms into a single, generalized form. Niman balances out the various specializations of the other forms, covering many of the basic moves, but focusing on overall moderation. This results in a fighting style that lacks a significant advantage, but also lacks any serious drawbacks, and thereby does not leave adherents as exposed as some of the more aggressive or specialized forms.

To compensate for the relaxed focus on bladework and lack of significant specialization, Niman training regimens encourage the inclusion of Force-based attacks in combat, such as [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|telekinetic]] pulls and shoves used in sync with lightsaber strikes. Also, as Niman was developed from two pre-existing martial arts fighting forms that both emphasized the use of dual-blades (including [[Forms & Martial Arts/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai]]), it provides a firm foundation for duelists looking to study into such practices. Ultimately, Niman's success in combat is dependent on a practitioner's intuition and creativity in combat, rather than the rote responses common to the other forms.

According to Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig, if a duelist dedicated himself exclusively to Form VI, he could expect to study the style for at least ten years before achieving mastery.

As a dual-wield form, some refer to it as a [[Forms & Martial Arts/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai tactic]]. Interestingly, Niman was originally developed by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Legions of Lettow\|Legions of Lettow]], a sect of Dark Jedi that broke away from the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] and named the Form after the Kashi gods that they worshipped. Nevertheless, it still found its way into the Order's teachings.

## Stances
The opening stance of the Niman form is wide and open, with the blade held out from the body in a one-handed grip, the blade angled upwards and back, while the off-hand is folded across the chest. The feet are evenly spaced.

Another Niman stance features the blade held at head-height in a two-handed grip, angled upwards and slightly in, with the dominant foot placed forwards.

A third position is a two-handed low guard, with the hilt held at waist height in both hands, blade held back and to the side, angled downwards, with the feet closely spaced.

## Common Maneuvers
In keeping with the tactic of incorporating Force powers into combat, two primary Form VI maneuvers, the *draw closer* and the *pushing slash*, are conjunctions between lightsaber moves andÂ [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Telekinesis]] attacks. Effectively polar opposites of one another, the *draw closer* involves telekinetically seizing an opponent and pulling the enemy into the path of his blade, while the *pushing slash* slams the opponent with a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Push\|Force Push]] after scoring an attack.
