# Trákata
Trákata is an uncommon technique in [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|lightsaber combat]]. It is not necessarily its own form, but rather a strategy that can be combined with more traditional forms. When utilizing trákata, a practitioner will rapidly shut off and then re-ignite their lightsaber to confuse opponents, allow diversional feints, or get under and around blocks and parries. It can be highly deadly but equally dangerous for the wielder. 

Trákata is a technique that relies on practical combat and deception as opposed to patience or brute strength. For this reason, this technique was traditionally shunned by both the Sith and the Jedi. While the Sith viewed it as a sign of weakness and lack of physical power, the Jedi considered it "unsportsmanlike" and needlessly dangerous.

## Common Maneuvers 
The *Pass the Blade* maneuver refers to a duelist deactivating their lightsaber as they attack, bypassing an opponent's block before re-igniting it into the opponent's body. This maneuver is largely used to evade a parry or stop an opponent from deflecting an attack, particularly where the opponent is physically stronger. 

*Unbalancing Block* refers to the duelist catching the opponent's blade against their own, before momentarily de-activating it to cause the opponent to stumble when the resistance disappears. This was one of the riskier maneuvers, as it relied on the duelist's fast reflexes — either to catch the blade again to deflect it or dodge out of the way of any completed swing or momentum. 

*Flash Slash* is when the duelist activates their lightsaber for a moment, allowing just enough time for the blade to reach full length while being swung, before de-activating it again. This maneuver is usually used to confuse and throw off an opponent, but it can also be used when the duelist is moving in a way that makes dodging their own blade problematic.
