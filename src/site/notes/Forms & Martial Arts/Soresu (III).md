# Soresu 
>The Way of the Mynock, The Resilience Form

Soresu is often considered the ultimate expression of the non-aggressive Jedi philosophy. Soresu relies on economy of motion and energy efficiency, keeping up constant blade movement to build up momentum and minimize energy expenditure. Form III focuses on strong defensive technique to essentially outlast an opponent, waiting until they begin making mistakes due to frustration or fatigue, before taking advantage of these lapses and countering. 

The core tenets of Soresu encourage duelists to place themselves "within the eye of the storm": to maintain a calm center, undistracted and undisturbed by the conflict around them. In keeping with this idea, Soresu incorporates powerful defensive techniques that are flexible enough to adapt to almost any circumstance, at the cost of never reaching past the figurative "eye of the storm." In other words, Soresu focuses almost entirely on self-defense, often at the expense of offensive capabilities.

Despite its effectiveness, Soresu is heavily criticized for its lack of offensive capabilities, as it facilitates survival rather than victory. The more aggressive forms, [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]] and [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Shien]], were developed simultaneously to address this passivity.

## Stances
For the Form III opening stance, the duelist holds the blade back in a one-handed grip, angled forwards with the blade arm held parallel, the other hand held up in a challenge. The dominant foot is positioned back.

The brace-ready stance has much in common with the "[[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]] guard," with the hilt held at waist height on the dominant side in a two-handed grip for greater control, extended vertically upwards. The dominant foot is placed back while the other is extended forwards and to the side in a brace position.

A variation on this stance features the blade held high in a drop-parry position, though the foot positions are the same.

## Common Maneuvers
Against individual shooters, Form III duelists were encouraged to apply the *Deflecting Slash*. This move served the dual purposes of allowing a Jedi to redirect the momentum generated by deflecting an enemy projectile into a slashing attack at an adjacent target, and allowing the Jedi to advance and close the distance before the attacker could fire another shot. A careful application allowed a Jedi to redirect the shot back at the attacker, though this skill was more commonly applied by Shien practitioners. 

Against multiple blaster-wielding attackers, the *Circle of Shelter* was advised. This technique allowed a Soresu practitioner to hold off as many as twenty shooters by dropping into a moving meditation, relying on the Force to perceive the various positions of the attackers and the necessary movements to evade or deflect their shots. As this maneuver was executed while in a meditative state, prolonged use could open a Force-adept's mind to visions of the future.
