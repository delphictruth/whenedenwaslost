# Teräs Käsi

Teräs Käsi is a deadly and mystical martial art discipline renowed throughout the galaxy for its lethality. It was developed by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Followers of Palawa\|Followers of Palawa]] solely to fight and combat the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], and to ensure that another world would not be destroyed by the Jedi. 

Named *steel hands* in Basic, this art emphasized powerful blows and precise strikes. It is said that masters could punch through body armor, developing a blinding speed and uncanny ability to anticipate strikes and dodge attacks. Practitioners have a high degree of acrobatics, using their talents to direct their falls and avoid deadly collisions. 

Its movements are patterned after the movements and hunting characteristics of various beasts throughout the galaxy, marked by close work; utilizing hands, feet, eblows, blades, and sticks; basic stances relying on four ranges of engagement: kicking, punching, elbowing, and grappling range. Some of the moves were also named after such beasts, such as *Charging Wampa*, *Rancor Rising*, and *Dancing Dragonsnake*.

Teräs Käsi also featured a meditative arts. Practioners relied on extreme control of their bodies, and they applied that control inwards as well; they were able to enter an immobile meditative trance-like state and stop bleeding, slow poisons, and counter diseases. Masters could even begin to heal their own wounds by channeling their mental energy back towards themselves with this control.
