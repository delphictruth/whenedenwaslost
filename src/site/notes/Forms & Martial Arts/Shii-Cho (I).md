# Shii-Cho
>Way of the Sarlacc, Determination Form

This combat form was developed during the transitional period within the Jedi Order from ancient metal swords to more contemporary lightsabers. It established basic motions and target zones, but was not designed with lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat in mind. For that reason, it fulfills a niche as a training form, with almost every Jedi duelist receiving some instruction in it, and including elements in their own combat styles. Shii-Cho is considered an effective fall-back option when no other form or combat style would do.

Shii-Cho swordplay is simplistic and raw. In the hands of a master, the bladework is described as "like watching water flow over the falls." However, this form looks clumsy with less disciplined practitioners, given its requirement of deliberate tactics and constant emotional regulation. 

It is characterized by wide, sweeping motions ideal for engaging multiple opponents. The blade-work consists of a lot of perfectly horizontal and vertical angles, attacks and parries falling perpendicular or diagonal to one another. 

Shii-Cho philosophy emphasizes victory without injury, so every move is geared towards quickly disarming an opponent before the fight can escelate.
