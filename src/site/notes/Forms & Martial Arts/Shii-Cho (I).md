# Shii-Cho
>Way of the Sarlacc, Determination Form

This combat form was developed during the transitional period within the Jedi Order from ancient metal swords to more contemporary lightsabers. It established basic motions and [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat#Body Target Zones\|target zones]], but was not designed with lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat in mind. For that reason, it fulfills a niche as a training form, with almost every Jedi duelist receiving some instruction in it, and including elements in their own combat styles. Shii-Cho is considered an effective fall-back option when no other form or combat style would do.

Shii-Cho swordplay is simplistic and raw. In the hands of a master, the bladework is described as "like watching water flow over the falls." However, this form looks clumsy with less disciplined practitioners, given its requirement of deliberate tactics and constant emotional regulation. 

It is characterized by wide, sweeping motions ideal for engaging multiple opponents. The blade-work consists of a lot of perfectly horizontal and vertical angles, attacks and parries falling perpendicular or diagonal to one another. 

Shii-Cho philosophy emphasizes victory without injury, so every move is geared towards quickly disarming an opponent before the fight can escalate; the [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat#Sun djem\|sun djem]] Mark of Contact is the most traditional of moves.

## Stances
The Form I opening stance is a defensive stance, in which the practitioner holds the lightsaber before them, blade angled upwards with the hilt in front of their navel or chest. Some practitioners choose to twist their body slightly, or hold the lightsaber a bit to the side of their body as opposed to directly in front of them.

## Common Maneuvers
Keeping with the use of *sun djem*, one of the attacks utilized by Form I practitioners is referred to as the *Disarming Slash*, consisting of a strike directed at the opponent's weapon in an attempt to rip it out of their grasp.

Another of the techniques utilized by Shii-Cho is dubbed the *Sarlacc Sweep*, a wide sweeping attack in which the duelist strikes against multiple enemies. 

Other maneuvers include use of the basic Form I *horizontal slash*.
