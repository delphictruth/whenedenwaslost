# Shien / Djem So
>The Way of the Krayt Dragon, The Perseverance Form

Form V combat is meant to address the disadvantages of a more defense-focused form, such as [[Forms & Martial Arts/Soresu (III)\|Form III]].  It is characterized by powerful attacks and defenses that are immediately followed by a counter-attack. It is sometimes considered too violent of a form, based on its high physical demand and focus on complete dominance over an opponent.

Whereas a failing of Shien is its weakness against a single opponent, Djem So is known for having a lack of mobility. Otherwise, Shien is designed more towards long-range combat, while Djem So is designed specifically for dueling.

## Shien
Considered the class variant of Form V, Shien was developed with a focus of holding a strong defense while still being open to counter-attacks. For that reason, it is considered the best form to deal with multiple enemies, in particular blaster fire. 

### Shien Stances and Maneuvers
The Shien opening stance is a high guard position, with the lightsaber hilt held in a two-handed grip above the user's head and the blade angled upward and behind the user. The dominant leg is held back, enabling powerful step-through strikes to be utilized.

Shien users are also proficient in a maneuver referred to as the *Barrier of Blades*, which defends the user from blaster fire and redirects some of the incoming blasts. 

*Shien Deflection* is another technique familiar to users of that Form V variant, allowing practitioners to simultaneously deflect weapons fire and leap toward an opponent.

A somewhat controversial and unorthodox form of Shien involves the *reverse Shien grip*, wherein the wielder whips the blade forward with the movement of throwing a punch. Some Jedi Masters frowned on this usage. 

## Djem So
Djem So is designed to address the passivity of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Soresu (III)\|Soresu]], with a focus devoted specifically to lightsaber dueling. Utilizing a combination of blocks and parries, a Djem So user maintains a proper foundation of defense against both ranged and melee attacks. Immediately after defending against an opponent's strike, a Djem So specialists follows with a counter-attack, bringing the force of the opponent's blow against them to dominate the duel. Djem So places a heavy focus on brute strength and pure power, making it the most physically demanding of forms. 

Djem So requires the user not only to counterattack, but also to press the assault, combining Force-enhanced strength with powerful blade combinations to overpower and overwhelm an opponent's defenses.

### Djem So Stances and Maneuvers
The Djem So attack stance consists of holding the lightsaber above the head, angled back and down at an approximately forty-five degree angle. 

The characteristic Djem So attack is dubbed the *Falling Avalanche*, an overhand power blow that crashes down upon an opponent with exceptional force.

Djem So users also employ a tactic known as the *Fluid Riposte*, which involved a smooth transition from parrying an attack to a counterstrike.
