# Dun Möch
Dun Möch is a technique that uses distraction and doubt, usually through taunting, in conjunction with [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|lightsaber combat]]. It is a Sith technique developed by the [[Organizations/Brotherhood of Darkness\|Brotherhood of Darkness]] and was frowned upon by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] but not explicitly prohibited (and has been used by some Jedi). It embodies using the Force as a form of psychological warfare. 

A Dun Möch practitioner aims to completely dominate their opponent's spirit, slowly and steadily demoralizing an opponent through the use of taunts, jeers, and jests that expose an opponent's hidden inner weaknesses and doubts. The practitioner may also use [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telepathy\|telepathic]] mental attacks with similar effect. 

This technique is one that requires patience, as a true Dun Möch practitioner will draw out a battle and withhold the final blow until their opponent is utterly defeated on a psychological level. 

One major drawback of the Dun Möch technique is the potential unpredictability of an opponent and their reaction to taunts. A practitioner may spur an opponent on through anger instead of breaking their will or overwhelming their with fear, which may make them more difficult to defeat. Thus, Dun Möch practitioners must be prepared to deal with the heightened aggression that can backfire against them. 

*"Make him doubt himself, his beliefs, or his intentions. Such things disrupt connections to the Force—and death soon follows."* — HK-47 to Meetra Surik

An extreme practice of Dun Möch relies on advance plotting to set up their opponent for psychological destruction. For example, practitioners have faked deaths of loved ones to taunt an opponent or lied and schemed to draw an opponent to certain vulnerable locations, where they would ultimately meet their demise.
