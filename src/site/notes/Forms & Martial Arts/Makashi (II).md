# Makashi 
>The Way of the Ysalamiri, The Contention Form

Makashi was developed specifically for the purposes of lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat and is the most dueling-centric of the classical forms. It values precision and efficiency over [[Forms & Martial Arts/Shii-Cho (I)\|Form I]]'s wild, sweeping motions, allowing a duelist to defend with minimal effort and avoid disarmament. 

Makashi is described as an elegant and focused form, relying on fluidity and economy of motion over sheer power or force. Practitioners move in precise forward-back steps, with back-and-forth charges, thrusts, and sudden retreats that could give experts the appearance of dancing. Most Makashi practitioners duel one-handed, granting greater range of motion and lightness of steps. 

The drawbacks of Makashi come from its development as a one-on-one, dueling form. It offers less protection against long-ranged attacks, such as blaster bolts, and may be less effective against large groups. Further, it is a style that lacks momentum and leaves practitioners open to being overpowered by sheer brute force and strength.

## Stances
The Form II opening stance is a single-handed low guard. The saber is held in the dominant hand, at their side with the blade pointed down. Practitioners stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, occasionally facing an opponent side-on with the blade pointed in their direction. The lightsaber hilt is held with the thumb pointing down the length of the blade to allow for smaller, tighter, more accurate movements of the saber. The grip should be tight, but not so tight as to limit the fluidity of movements. 

As part of the Makashi opening stance, practitioners generally begin with a *Makashi salute*. The typical Makashi flourish consists of rapidly moving the tip of the blade in an X shaped pattern through the air. The salute is not an attack or maneuver but a challenge to an opponent. The saber is held in one hand, brought up vertical directly in front of the practitioner's face, then swung down in a flourish.

## Common Maneuvers
Makashi duelists focus on [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|Marks of Contact]], particularly the *sun djem* and *shiak*. The typical Form II applications of the _sun djem_ feature precise attacks directed at the weapon itself, often destroying it or even burning through an opponent's fingers to disarm them. Application of the _shiak_ is a natural result of Form II footwork and swordplay, all of which follow a single back-and-forth line, and is seen as an indication of skill and control.

The *contentious opportunity* maneuver is based around recognizing and exploiting an opening in the opponent's defense before swiftly moving to strike the exposed enemy. The *Makashi riposte* is similarly designed to slightly alter the angle of an opponent's attack before quickly retaliating with a counter strike.
