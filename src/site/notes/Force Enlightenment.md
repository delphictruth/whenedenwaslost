# Force Enlightenment 
When activated, this power takes the Force powers a Jedi is most skilled in, pushing them to the highest degree that the Jedi has mastered during his or her routine training. 

Typically, Enlightenment will be used on [[Force speed|Force speed]], [[Force Shield|Force Shield]], and [[Force Valor|Force Valor]]. The end result is an "enlightened" Jedi.
