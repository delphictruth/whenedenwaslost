# Book XIII Duel
The first Hazille lightsaber duel in **Book XIII** mostly focuses on [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] naturally adjusting to [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|Lightsaber combat]] and acquiring some of [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]]'s training through [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Probe\|drain knowledge]]. Hazel unwittingly embodies several forms and techniques; in contrast, Ani consciously adjusts his style to match her. 
### First Phase
Ani begins with and frequently defaults to [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]]'s opening stance, with his lightsaber held to the side and angled slightly downwards.

Hazel adopts an opening stance based on how she handles her staff and her instinctive feel for the lightsaber (with the blade held before her face, horizontal and at eye height). It does not quite correlate with any traditional Form's opening stance.

Similarly, her opening move is a fairly similar to how she fights with her staff — a sweeping swing around her head leading into a horizontal slash.

Hazel pushes her offensive with wild, sweeping movements that reflect [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]]'s kinetic energy and constantly offensive.

> To an outsider, Form IV appears to be a blur of lunges and leaps. Its acrobatic style is best practiced by Jedi who possess talents for enhancing their speed and stamina through the Force. 

In comparison, Ani relies mostly on the defensive nature of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Soresu (III)\|Soresu]] in the initial phase of combat — little movement, economical motions, with all moves pulled close to the body. 

However, once Hazel lands a blow to his side, he is forced to switch to his off-hand and shifts to a more complicated iteration of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]], combining [[Forms & Martial Arts/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo]] aggression with [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Djem So]]'s style of offense. The opening stance he uses is a mix of Juyo stances. 

> Vicious and unpredictable, Form VII requires a Jedi to attack under the guidance of controlled passion. It is this aspect that has caused the most consternation among the Order, for proper execution of Juyo seemingly puts a Jedi in violation of one of the Code's core precepts: *There is no emotion, there is peace.*

> Djem So follows the same philosophy of turning an enemy's attack back on him or her, but it is optimized for lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat. Its signature move is the fluid riposte, which deflects a forceful enemy attack and immediately counterattacks. The emphasis of Djem So remains strength, with violent blows—such as the Falling Avalanche, or overhand blow, to shatter armor—that can penetrate any defense.

With Ani on the offensive, Hazel starts to make a retreat and unknowingly continues to act with [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]] influence:

> Even so, Form IV is exhausting and is best employed in short but devastating bursts. Thus, if you cannot find a way to penetrate your opponent's defenses after repeated efforts, it is best to withdraw from a fight you are not likely to win.
### Phase Two
The turning point of the duel comes when Hazel uses [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Probe\|drain knowledge]] to "download" some of Ani's training. In doing so, she hears him recite the opening lines of the [[Library/Oaths/Code of the Jedi\|Code of the Jedi]]; these lines are also the starting point for a Padawan's training. 

(The first line — *There is no emotion, there is peace* — also happens to be the one that is said to be violated by [[Forms & Martial Arts/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo]], ironically. Fittingly, the second line — *There is no ignorance, there is knowledge* — relates directly to the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Probe\|drain knowledge]] technique.)

After acquiring some of Ani's training, Hazel's style shifts and begins to reflect elements of his. She naturally falls into [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]]'s alternative opening stance — a two-handed low-guard stance, with the blade angled downwards.

But when Ani points this out and asks her about [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]], she adopts the [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]] opening stance instead: a two-handed high guard, holding the lightsaber vertically to the side of her body. 
![Pasted image 20230920232110.png](/img/user/Photos/Pasted%20image%2020230920232110.png)
When she goes on the offensive, Hazel is still using the sweeping movements of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]], but she also begins to mirror the quick parries and counterattacks of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Djem So]] that Ani used in the first phase of the fight. 

At one point she briefly tests a reverse grip, copying his preferred hold, before switching back to a forward grip. The spin that she "stole" from him is essentially the HC spin:

### Phase Three
When Ani laughs at Hazel, she lets her anger take ahold of her and effectively loses control. Here she continues to employ [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]]'s flowing movement with the rapid [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Djem So]] counterstrikes, but she is fully plunged into the rage of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo]] and on an aggressive offensive. (Note: This is still [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]].)

Her [[Forms & Martial Arts/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo]] form is noticeably wilder than Ani's controlled style, demonstrating both her anger and her inexperience with the practice of Form VII:

> However, Form VII masters do not give themselves to emotion blindly. They channel their inner turmoil into a mental forge, which provides the passion to power their raw and furious strikes. A true expert keeps the emotions locked within the forge. Lesser practitioners of the art might allow their emotions to spill out during battle, poisoning their intentions and drawing them into the fury of a dark side rage.

In response, Ani takes a largely defensive approach, using minimal movements to counter her strikes and limiting his range of motion, with a focus on redirecting her momentum until she calms. He is mostly relying on [[Forms & Martial Arts/Makashi (II)\|Makashi]].

> Makashi was developed specifically for the purposes of lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat and is the most dueling-centric of the classical forms. It values precision and efficiency over [[Forms & Martial Arts/Shii-Cho (I)\|Form I]]'s wild, sweeping motions, allowing a duelist to defend with minimal effort and avoid disarmament. 

At the stalemate, Hazel utilizes a [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]] technique when she [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Force pushes]] Ani back, another method she inadvertently learned from him. When she breaks his wrist and disarms him, she technically scores a *sun djem* [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|mark of contact]] against him. However, *sun djem* is meant to be non-aggressive; it is more accurately categorized as an attempt to amputate his weapon hand, *cho mai*.

The final [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|mark of contact]] that Hazel lands is *sai cha*, a slash across Ani's throat that he deflects with a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Force push]]. Although such a maneuver is not technically considered a prohibited by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], it is typically frowned upon:

> *Sai cha* is the act of cutting an enemy's head from his shoulders. It is never the intention of a Jedi to extinguish a fellow life, for even the worst of us exists as a luminous being in the warmth of the Force. But when required, a lightsaber can also kill.

(In **Book XIV**, [[Characters/Imperia Sibyl\|Imperia Sibyl]] lists *sai tok*, *cho mai*, and *sai cha* as [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|marks of contact]] that Hazel landed on Ani. Respectively, those are the strikes to his side, wrist, and throat.)

It is because Hazel strikes under the influence of her rage and hatred that the [[Crystals/Ankarres Sapphire\|Ankarres Sapphire]] in [[Characters/Octavia Bonteri\|Octavia Bonteri]]'s lightsaber burns her palm.
