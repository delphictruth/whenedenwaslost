# Oaths in Book XIII
In **Book XIII**, [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] chains together several snippets from different oaths and codes. In the beginning of the chapter, he switches back and forth through the different codes, typically linked through words or concepts.
> There is no death. There is no death. There is the Force. ([[Library/Oaths/Code of the Jedi\|Code of the Jedi]])
> Freedom in life. Purpose in death. There is no death. No death, no death, nodeath— ([[Library/Oaths/Gray Jedi Code\|Gray Jedi Code]])
> Ashajontû kotswinot itsu nuyak. Wonoksh Qyâsik nun, wonokshqyâsiknun, WONOKSHOYÂSIKNUN— (*"Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me, theForceshallfreeme, THEFORCESHALLFREEME"*) ([[Library/Oaths/Code of the Sith\|Code of the Sith]])
> —freedom in life. Purpose in death. ([[Library/Oaths/Gray Jedi Code\|Gray Jedi Code]])
> —no emotion, peace— ([[Library/Oaths/Code of the Jedi\|Code of the Jedi]])
> Nwûl tash. Dzwol shâsotkun. Nwûl tash, nwûl tash, dzwol shâsotkun— (*"Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Peace is a lie, peace is a lie, there is only passion"*) ([[Library/Oaths/Code of the Sith\|Code of the Sith]])
> —no passion without peace to guide ([[Library/Oaths/Gray Jedi Code\|Gray Jedi Code]])
> There is no death. ([[Library/Oaths/Code of the Jedi\|Code of the Jedi]])

Later, while [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] is using [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Probe\|drain knowledge]] during her fight with [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]], she hears him begin to recite the first lines of the [[Library/Oaths/Code of the Jedi\|Code of the Jedi]]. Importantly, the first line (*no emotion, peace*) is associated with the [[Library/Jedi Traditions/Jedi Trials\|Trial of the Flesh]] of the Knight Trials.
>There is no emotion, there is peace.
>There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
