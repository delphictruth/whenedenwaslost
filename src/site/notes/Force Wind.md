# Force Wind
Force Wind is considered a Dark power. It allows the user to manipulate and channel air currents, primarily to create destructive tornadoes. 

An alternative form practiced by the Light side users was known as <u>Force Whirlwind</u>. This technique is very similar, but it is less powerful and considered an in between of the [[Force Push|Force Push]] and [[Force Wave|Force Wave]]. Typically the whirlwind is only strong enough to simply hold the victim in place.

The [[Witches of Dathomir|Witches of Dathomir]] refer to is as the <u>Spell of Storm</u>.
