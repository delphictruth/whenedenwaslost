# Force immersion
Force immersion is a specialized technique developed by the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Fallanassi\|Fallanassi]], by which a skilled user can immerse themselves in the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Fallanassi White Current\|White Current]], rendering themselves undetectable by any means, organic or artificial. Only careful scrutiny can pierce the immersion technique, and even then the weak-minded will remain oblivious to their presence unless the Fallanassi in question interacts with them. 

Masters of Force immersion are capable of immersing others outside of themselves, such as another person or even objects, into the Current as well. This ability can extend to fleets and even full settlements. They can also create permanent Fallanassi illusions, which do not require sustained meditation to maintain but do draw energy from the presence of their creators or other Adepts.
