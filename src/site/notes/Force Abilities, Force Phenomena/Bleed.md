# Bleeding
Bleeding is the process that a darksider uses bends a [[Crystals/Lightsaber crystal\|lightsaber crystal]] to their will, turning it red. It can sometimes alter the properties of the crystal as well, but generally just re-attunes the blade to respond better to Dark side energy or else allows formly Light-only crystals to respond to a darksider.

The process requires the wielder to channel rage, hatred, fear, and pain into the crystal during focused meditation. It can be quite difficult, as the crystal typically resists the corruption, and sometimes can result in shattering or cracking the crystal. 

It is possible for some Light side users to [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/purify\|purify]] corrupted crystals, which would bring them back to the Light side and change their color. Sometimes the color would return to its old form, but usually the blades would become white.
