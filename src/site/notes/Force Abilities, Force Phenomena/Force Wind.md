# Force Wind
Force Wind is considered a Dark power. It allows the user to manipulate and channel air currents, primarily to create destructive tornadoes. 

An alternative form practiced by the Light side users was known as *Force Whirlwind*. This technique is very similar, but it is less powerful and considered an in between of the [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force Push\|Force Push]] and [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force Wave\|Force Wave]]. Typically the whirlwind is only strong enough to simply hold the victim in place.

The [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Witches of Dathomir\|Witches of Dathomir]] refer to is as the *Spell of Storm*.
