# Receptive Telepathy
Receptive telepathy is a Sense-base Force power which allows Force-users to actively read a person's thoughts and feel their emotions. In some cases, the Force-user can search a target's memories for specific information. It is easier to use on individuals who are close to the Force-user emotionally, and some individuals, such as other Force-users, can actively resist the technique. 

It is not necessarily the same as the Dark-side technique [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Mind Probe\|Mind Probe]], but is it very similiar. The distinction is that receptive telepathy is considered a more universal power, less invasive, and can be utilized without actually entering into the target's thoughts. Users are sometimes called *empaths*.
