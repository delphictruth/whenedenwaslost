- Also known as *danger sense*, *Third Sight*

# Precognition
A deeper form of [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force sense\|Force sense]], more tuned towards sensing future events and premonitions, especially from objects. It is essentially the opposite power to [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Psychometry\|Psychometry]], which senses the past. 

[[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Battle Precognition\|Battle Precognition]] is a hightened version of this technique, specially attuned to an active battle. 

Precognition can also be a lead-in to a specific technique that utilizes [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Shatterpoint\|Shatterpoint]], seeing how the precognition can aid in perceiving those points. 

The [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Chiss\|Chiss]] refer to this ability as *Third Sight*, and in their heightened form it allows them to navigate through hyperspace safely without hyperlanes.
