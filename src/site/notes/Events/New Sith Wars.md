# New Sith Wars
The New Sith Wars is the name given to the thousand years of conflict between the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] and several factions of Sith, which lasted from approximately [[Events/Timeline\|2000 BBY]] to [[Events/Timeline\|1000 BBY]]. As an era, it was characterized by a spectacular rise of the Sith, the decline of the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]], and a growing militancy in the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]. The Republic was frequently in danger of being overwhelmed completely, and the New Sith Wars concluded the era known as the [[Events/Fall of the Old Republic\|Fall of the Old Republic]].

The New Sith Wars are frequently divided by historians into a series of shorter conflicts, with the last century of the conflict in particular commonly known as the *Republic Dark Age*. The final series of battles between the Jedi [[Organizations/Army of Light\|Army of Light]] and the Sith [[Organizations/Brotherhood of Darkness\|Brotherhood of Darkness]] is known as the *Light and Darkness War*. 

**Year**:: 2000 BBY to 1000 BBY
## Fourth Great Schism
The Fourth Great Schism refers to the a schism of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] in 2000 BBY, one of the many in the Order's history. It was led by former Jedi Master turned Sith Lord [[Characters/Darth Ruin\|Darth Ruin]], who convinced Jedi Knights to desert the Order to join his malevolent order. This marked the rebirth of the Sith under the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]], interrupting thousands of years of peace and stability and renewing conflict against the Jedi. It is also considered the start of the New Sith Wars.
## Sith Ascendancy
The period of the New Sith Wars from 2000 BBY to 1250 BBY is often referred to as the Sith Ascendancy. During these decades, the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]] grew in strength and numbers, reclaiming several traditional Sith worlds — such as [[Navigational/Planets/Yavin 4\|Yavin 4]] and [[Navigational/Planets/Ziost\|Ziost]] — while several other Sith factions developed and grew. Following [[Characters/Darth Ruin\|Darth Ruin]]'s demise, the [[Organizations/Black Knights\|Black Knights]] and [[Characters/Darth Rivan\|Darth Rivan]] became even more powerful in his absence. 

While the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] aided the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]] during these decades, it was remarkably outnumbered and could not rise to meet the Sith threat properly. It took nearly five centuries for the Jedi and Republic to mount an armed force strong enough to begin winning victories. However, they were rapidly plunged back into turmoil following the infamous [[Events/Battle of Mizra\|Battle of Mizra]] and the resulting decline in civilization across the galaxy. 

By the end of the Sith Ascendancy period, conditions had grown so bad for the Republic that the [[HoloNet\|HoloNet]] had collapsed along with interstellar commerce. Jedi were forced to become more involved in leadership, commanding the Republic military and assuming roles in government. From 1400 BBY to 1000 BBY, Jedi served in the post of Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.
## The Sictis Wars
The period from 1250 BBY to 1230 BBY is known as the Sictis Wars. A Sith Lord from [[Navigational/Planets/Tython\|Tython]] was the main power among the Sith, waging war against the Jedi and the Republic with the use of [[Technobeasts\|Technobeasts]] until she was killed by another faction of Sith in response to unwanted incursions on [[Navigational/Sectors/Tapani sector\|Tapani]] territory. 
## Dark Republic Age
The Dark Republic Age, sometimes referred to as merely the *Dark Age*, ranged from 1230 BBY to approximately 1130 BBY. The Sith were deeply divided amongst themselves, fighting one another for supremacy, but they continued to rampage across the galaxy virtually unhindered and oppress entire star systems. 

The Republic had declined into a pale shadow of what it once was and was unable to focus on combatting the Sith, even as the Sith fought themselves. While the Republic was not under as constant attack, it had already lost a significant amount of its territory to the Sith and made almost no attempt to regain any of its old worlds. 

Meanwhile, the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] attempted to combat the Sith on smaller scales, routing individual systems of Sith influence and coming to be seen as the last line of defense for many of those systems. This role contributed to the Jedi's rise in political power and their service as Supreme Chancellors. 
## The Sith Civil War
The Sith Civil War, also known as the *Charge Matrica*, lasted from 1066 BBY to 1010 BBY and contributed to the slow decline of Sith power and the New Sith Wars era. The [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]] lost power as a result of the in-fighting and eventually ceded to the emerging power of the [[Organizations/Brotherhood of Darkness\|Brotherhood of Darkness]]. 
## The Light and Darkness War
The Light and Darkness War refers to the final decade of the New Sith Wars, characterized by the clash between the [[Organizations/Brotherhood of Darkness\|Brotherhood of Darkness]] and [[Organizations/Army of Light\|Army of Light]].
