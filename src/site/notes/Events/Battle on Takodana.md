# Battle on Takodana

The Battle on Takodana occurred during the Resistance-First Order War on [[Navigational/Planets/Takodana\|Takodana]], outside of [[Characters/Maz Kanata\|Maz Kanata]]'s Castle. The [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] intercepted a [[Organizations/Resistance\|Resistance]] rendezvous between [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]] and [[Characters/Malkyn Rodarch\|Malkyn Rodarch]] and surprised them on [[Navigational/Planets/Takodana\|Takodana]], looking for the map to [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]].

During the Battle, [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] was separated from the rest of the Resistance and encountered the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] for the first time. [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] learned that Hazel had seen the map and captured her, marking the Knights' retreat and taking her back to the *Finalizer*.
