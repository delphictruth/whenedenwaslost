# Battle of Malachor V
The final battle of the Mandalorian Wars, also known as the "Great Last Battle" (*Ani'la Akaan*). It was a cataclysmic battle that turned the planet [[Navigational/Planets/Malachor V\|Malachor V]] into a "graveyard world" and was considered a pyrrhic victory for the Republic.

It was also one of Revan's most significant campaigns, with many accreditting its success to his tactics and ferocity. Notably, it was the first and only battle that featured the Super Mass Generator â€” a horrific weapon that consumed the majority of the Mandalorian and Republic fleets before unleashing a gravity vortex that fractured the planet's core. 

The destruction of Malachor V tore a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Wound in the Force\|Wound in the Force]] that lasts to this day. Destroyed vessels still orbit the planet and litter the surface, while the planet itself is marked by the warped energy of the death of thousands of Jedi, Republic soldiers, and Mandalorians. There are near constant tectonic storms on the surface, pulling nearby ships out of orbit.
