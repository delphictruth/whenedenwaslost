# Padawan Massacre

Infamously known as the Padawan Massacre, several Jedi Masters of the Jedi Covenant (a secret group of seers within the Jedi Order) had a shared Force vision while their Padawans were completing their final tests in 3964 BBY. Convinced that their Padawans would bring about the destruction of the Jedi Order and revive the Sith, the Masters arranged a false Knighting ceremony and slew their Padawans instead.
