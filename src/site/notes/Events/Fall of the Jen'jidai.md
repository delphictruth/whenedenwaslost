- Also known as *Pesegam's Fall*

# Fall of the Jen'jidai
Refers to the end of the [[Organizations/Jen'jidai Cult\|Jen'jidai Cult]] in the year 9 ABY. Jedi Knight [[Characters/Cecily Beaumont\|Cecily Beaumont]] was said to be responsible for the ultimate destruction of the Cult and their leader, Dark Lord [[Characters/Alban Draig\|Raegal Aurelius]]. 

The final battle took place in the [[Navigational/Moraband#Temple of Pesegam\|Temple of Pesegam]] on [[Navigational/Moraband\|Korriban]]. All that is really known for certain is that the Temple fell, destroying the Cult and portions of the [[Navigational/Moraband#Valley of the Dark Lords\|Valley of the Dark Lords]], and that [[Characters/Cecily Beaumont\|Cecily Beaumont]] never re-emerged.
