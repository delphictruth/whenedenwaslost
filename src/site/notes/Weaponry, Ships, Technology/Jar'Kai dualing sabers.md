# Jar'Kai dualing sabers
Swords developed by the [[Navigational/Atrisian Commonwealth\|Atrisian Commonwealth]], for use in their signature blade-work [[Lightsaber Combat/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai]]. They are generally thick bladed, with serated edges, but modern styles have their own flare and may only be Jar'Kai in nature by being a pair. 

The term is sometimes applied to lightsaber pairs as well, following the development of [[Lightsaber Combat/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai]] into a style of lightsaber combat as well.
