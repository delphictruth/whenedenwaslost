- Also known as *Jar'Kai tactic*

# Jar'Kai
>The original dual-bladed combat 

A dual-blade sword-fighting technique, Jar'Kai was first developed in [[Navigational/Atrisia\|Atrisia]]'s capital city and stylized for use with swords of the same name. [[Weaponry, Ships, Technology/Jar'Kai dualing sabers\|Jar'Kai dualing sabers]] come in pairs for this reason. It was later developed into a form of lightsaber combat, though without a particular form; it is instead considered a blanket term for dual-bladed combat, giving rise to the phrase "Jar'Kai tactic" for any style of dual-wielding. 

[[Lightsaber Combat/Niman (VI)\|Niman]] is considered a similar dual-blade technique, developed separately and stylized into the current Jedi lightsaber form, but may have been influenced by Jar'Kai and is occasionally referred to as a Jar'Kai tactic or even simply as Jar'Kai. Similar, the dual-bladed version of [[Lightsaber Combat/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]] is sometimes considered a Jar'Kai tactic as well.
