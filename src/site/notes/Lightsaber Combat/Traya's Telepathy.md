# Traya's Telepathy
>Way of the , Form

An unofficial form of lightsaber combat, and indeed one that is not necessarily a form at all. "Traya's Telepathy" is a little-known phrase used to refer to [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Darth Traya]]'s technique of using [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Telepathy\|Telepathy]] to wield three lightsabers at once. A practioner must hold all three aloft and fight with them through the Force. 

While it has only been seen or recorded with three lightsabers, it is not necessarily limited to such a number. Theoretically this technique can be used with any number of sabers, even one.
