# Darth Nihilus
>Dark Lord of the Sith Triumvirate

Darth Nihilus's true name has been lost to history, but at one time he was a Force-sensitive living on [[Navigational/Planets/Malachor V\|Malachor V]]. He was on the surface when the planet was destroyed during the [[Events/Battle of Malachor V\|Battle of Malachor V]] and survived the cataclysm, but he lost everything to the destruction and was warped by the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Wound in the Force\|Wound in the Force]] that developed in his grief. 

For some time following the [[Events/Battle of Malachor V\|Battle of Malachor V]], it was impossible to actually reach the surface of the planet due to the raging storms. Many survivors were trapped there, exposed to the Darkness, and Nihilus's pain soon manifested into a feeling of emptiness, a "hunger." It is said that he fed that hunger by [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force drain\|draining the life-force]] of other survivors, initially by accident but then to sate his never-ending hunger. 

This is how [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Darth Traya]] found him shortly after being corrupted by [[Navigational/Planets/Malachor V\|Malachor V]] herself. She offered to teach him the ways of the Force to sate his hunger and took him as one of her Sith apprentices. Eventually, he formed the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Sith Triumvirate\|Sith Triumvirate]] with [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Darth Traya]] and [[Characters/Darth Sion\|Darth Sion]], becoming known as the Lord of Hunger.
