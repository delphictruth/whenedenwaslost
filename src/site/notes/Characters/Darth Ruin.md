# Darth Ruin
Darth Ruin was a Jedi Master turned Sith Lord who was active during the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]] era, reigning as a Dark Lord of the Sith around 2000 BBY. 

As Jedi Master *Phanius*, he resigned his commission from the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] under seemingly amicable terms, citing ideological objections to the current Jedi dogma, and was commemorated as the first of the [[Library/Lost Twenty\|Lost Twenty]]. However, he defected with the true intention of pursuing prohibited dark teachings and later re-emerged in public society as *Darth Ruin*, the first Dark Lord of the Sith in a thousand years. He subsequently disrupted the long-lasting peace, led the rise of the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]], caused the Fourth Great Schism of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], and paved the way for the galactic scale conflict of the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]].

Darth Ruin authored the [[Library/Oaths/Creed of Ruin\|Creed of Ruin]].
