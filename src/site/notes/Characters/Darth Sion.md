# Darth Sion
>Dark Lord of the Sith Triumvirate

Darth Sion was a Sith Marauder from the age of the Great Sith War and originally a member of [[Characters/Exar Kun\|Exar Kun]]'s Sith Empire. When he was defeated during the War, he realized that he was able to rise from certain death and achieve a form of immortality by calling on the Dark side. Thus, he was able to live on, fighting first as a member of [[Characters/Revan\|Revan]]'s Sith Empire and then, following the end of the Jedi Civil War, as a member of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Sith Triumvirate\|Sith Triumvirate]]. 

It is believed that he was the one who convinced his fellow apprentice, [[Characters/Darth Nihilus\|Darth Nihilus]], to betray their master and cut her off from the Force. 

He eventually met his true end on [[Navigational/Planets/Malachor V\|Malachor V]], several years after the First Jedi Purge.
