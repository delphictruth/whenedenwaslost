Brief descriptions of combat style.

### Combat

Bardolph is a rigid [[Lightsaber Combat/Makashi (II)\|Makashi (II)]] specialist with absolutely no deviation in his style. His technique embodies tight control and economical movements, producing a very precise and deliberate manner of fighting. 

#### Force Beliefs & Usage
Bardolph doesn't practice any particular style of Force belief, nor does he necessarily believe in anything, for that matter. He lives more so by the acknowledgement that he is alive and what is happening is happening, without trying to decode the inner workings of Fate or the universe.
