## Combat

### Forms

Chevalier specializes in [[Lightsaber Combat/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo (VII)]], but his style is largely influenced by his practice of [[Lightsaber Combat/Trákata\|Trákata]], a rather risky and rare strategy that depends on igniting and extinguishing the lightsaber rapidly in combat. He dabbles a bit in [[Lightsaber Combat/Juyo (VII)\|Vaapad (VII)]] as well, but more so for its compliments to Juyo. His blade-work is graceful and light, but completely unpredictable and reckless.

## Weapons

### Jedi Saber

Chevalier's Jedi lightsaber has a [[Crystals/Ghostfire\|Ghostfire]] crystal, which creates a transparent blade that does not produce sound or color like a normal saber and tends to leave after-images. For that reason, it is extremely hard to keep track of and can even appear to be an illusion. It had a standard hilt style of white-washed steel. He lost in shortly after the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall]].

### Darksider Saber

Chevalier's darksider lightsaber is formed from a [[Crystals/Cunning of Tyranus\|Cunning of Tyranus]] crystal and a fairly typical red blade. It is an [[Crystals/Attuned crystal\|Attuned crystal]], such that only he can activate the saber. 

## History & Plot Significance

Chevalier was raised in the [[Navigational/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]] in a fairly simple lifestyle, far removed from the politics of the galaxy at large. His father had removed he and his elder brother from society in an effort to protect them from the rising tensions, but to no avail. [[Characters/Michael Hellix\|Michael Hellix]] was killed when Chev was 10, leaving he and his brother to fend for themselves.
