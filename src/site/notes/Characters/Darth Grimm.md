# Darth Grimm
>First Gatekeeper of the Telos Holocron

There is no recorded birth name for Darth Grimm, and reports of his existence are muddled. Most historians agree that he was once a Jedi Master during the Old Republic Era who joined the Sith Empire in pursuit of more knowledge. Whether or not he actually fell to the Dark side is heavily disputed. At most, it is undisputed he developed and curated the [[Library, Philosophies, Teachings/Telos Holocron\|Telos Holocron]] during [[Characters/Dark Lord Ragnos\|Dark Lord Ragnos]]'s rule. 

The name Darth Grimm has been applied retroactively, as there was no recorded name during the development of the holocron and there has yet to be any evidence of his existence as a Jedi. Initially referred to as *Telos*, known only as the creator of the holocron, he later was dubbed Darth Grimm after reports of his [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force ghosts\|Force ghost]] arose. He became widely known through the tales of his ghost appearing to Jedi on the brink of falling. It is said that he corrupts them to the Dark side in that moment of great weakness, hence the grim moniker (some claim the name Darth Grimm evolved from tales of the "Grim Ghost"). 

Those who claim that he never turned to the Dark during his life suggest a different story. They argue that he went to the Sith purely to learn their history and secrets, produced in his [[Library, Philosophies, Teachings/Telos Holocron\|Telos Holocron]], as there are no reports of his activity in the Sith Emperor aside from the development of the holocron. Not all of those in this camp agree about whether they believe the [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force ghosts\|Force ghost]] Darth Grimm is actually the same man who they call Telos. Some argue that his pursuit of knowledge was too great and that the Dark side claimed him in death, which is why he appears to Jedi struggling with their own pursuits of knowledge. 

The Jedi Order more or less accepted a similar story. Although his actual existence had always been in dispute, "Darth Grimm" was at the very least used as a story to warn Padawans against the dangers of thirsting for too much knowledge, or specifically, knowledge of the Dark. Some have gone so far as to claim that Darth Grimm truly is nothing more than a children's story, meant to scare young Padawans away from the Dark side.
