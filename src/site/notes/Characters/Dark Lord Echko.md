# Dark Lord Echko
> The Jedi-Killer, Sith Battlemaster

Echko Kaliya was a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] from [[Navigational/Planets/Tython\|Tython]] who chose to join the Dark Lord [[Characters/Belia Darzu\|Belia Darzu]] during the [[Events/New Sith Wars#The Sictis Wars\|Sictis Wars]], rising rapidly through her ranks to claim the title of Battlemaster. He was a master of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]] and unquestionably the most capable warrior in the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]], causing so much destruction that he became known as the *Jedi-Killer* long before he was considered a Dark Lord.

In [[Events/Timeline#1250 BBY – 1230 BBY\|1320 BBY]], he was tasked with hunting down Dark Lord Darzu's enemies in the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Mecrosa Order\|Mecrosa Order]], eliminating members of the coven one by one. Though he eventually bested their leader, High Lady [[Characters/Indigo Oceana\|Indigo Oceana]], in single combat, he chose to spare her life in honor of her vicious spirit — and, when she attacked him again the moment he released her, he decided to forsake his master to join Indigo instead. 

With his help, the Mecrosa Order was able to poison Belia Darzu. He became known as the Dark Lord Echko when he assumed her place at the head of the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]], though his rule was rather short-lived; soon after he ceded control to the [[Characters/Indigo Oceana\|High Lady]] and the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Mecrosa Order\|Mecrosa Order]], content to resume his role as assassin and Battlemaster. 

Though record of Echko and the fate of the Mecrosa Order is largely non-existent following the coup, the Order maintained control over the fortress on [[Navigational/Planets/Tython\|Tython]] for decades. The Order is said to have adopted facets of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Je'daii Order\|Je'daii Order]]'s teachings and revived the [[Library/Jedi Traditions/Great Journey\|Great Journey]].  

The collapse of Stav Kesh, Je'daii Temple of Martial Arts located on the Giant Ice Range, is largely unexplained — but some histories suggest that the temple crumbled when the Dark Lord Echko turned on the High Lady Indigo, inadvertently drowning them both in the destruction.
