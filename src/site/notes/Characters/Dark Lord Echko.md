raised in the Dark Side by Sith master and killed a considerable amount of Jedi; eventually met the Force sensitive girl, INDI, whom he was supposed to either force to be his apprentice or kill. She refused to turn, and Echko in turn killed his master; in the resulting crumbling on the temple, however, both Echko and Indi drowned. Extremely talented NIMAN duelist / battlemaster
