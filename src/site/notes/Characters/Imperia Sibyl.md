## Combat

Summary

### Forms

Imperia does not practice an traditional lightsaber form. She utilizes a unique style of combat that relies on telepathically controlling three sabers at once, allowing her to fight from a slight distance and with little personal movement. There is no known name for this style of combat, but some have used the phrase [[Lightsaber Combat/Traya's Telepathy\|Traya's Telepathy]] to refer to it.

## Weapons

### Jedi Sabers

Imperia's Jedi lightsabers were three identical sabers crafted from [[Crystals/Durindfire\|Durindfire]] crystals specifically [[Crystals/Attuned crystal\|attuned]] to maintain harmony with her Force signature and with one another. They were light blue with a silvery sheen granted by the crystal, with standard silver hilts. 

### Darksider Sabers

After the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]], Imperia [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Bleed\|bled]] her original lightsabers. While they became a pale red with a silvery sheen, there was very little change to their composition given the neutrality of their original alignment. 

## History & Plot Significance

â€” Imperia practices more removed methods of fighting and interacting with the Force; she generally physically passive, relying more so on her strong spiritual connection to the Force and the reliance on mental techniques and magicks; more cult-like appreciation
extreme serenity and eerie sense of self-purpose and sacred righteousness
