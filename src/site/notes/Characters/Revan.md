# Revan
>The Butcher, Dark Lord of the Sith, Prodigal Knight

Revan is one of the most divisive figures in the history of both the Jedi and the Sith. 

"_Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things, Revan… and yet you are nothing. In the end, you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone._" — Darth Malak

As a Padawan of the Jedi Order, Revan trained under several different Masters, including Jedi Master [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Kreia]], and rose quickly to the rank of Jedi Knight. Along with his friend and fellow Knight [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Alek]], Revan was considered a vocal and charismatic critic of the Jedi Order's inactivity in the Mandalorian Wars currently being waged between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorians.

In defiance of the Jedi Council's orders, he adopted the name Revan for the first time and led the Revanchist movement — a faction of Jedi who decided to join the Mandalorian Wars under his lead. [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Alek]] was one of them. 

After a decisive victory to mark their entrance into the War, Revan was named Supreme Commander of the Republic's Military and went on to lead the war against the Mandalorians. He is accredited with the Republic's eventual victory and was renowned among the Republic and the Revanchist. 

Following the [[Events/Battle of Malachor V\|Battle of Malachor V]], the battle that marked Revan's victory over the Mandalorians, Revan and [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Alek]] chose to pursue the strange Sith energy that they had sensed on [[Navigational/Malachor V\|Malachor V]]. Thus, they disappeared rather than return to the Jedi Order. 

He and [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Alek]] re-emerged from the Unknown Regions as Dark Lords of the Sith *Darth Revan* and *Darth Malak*. Initially under the Sith Emperor's control, they eventually broke free and waged their own war against the Republic and Jedi Order. It was a devastating war, marked by many of Revan's fellow followers and supporters turning to the Dark side to join him once more. 

During an attack on their capital ship by the Jedi, Revan was betrayed by his friend and apprentice, [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Darth Malak]], and captured by Jedi Knight Bastila Shan. Rather than kill the Sith Lord, Bastila saved Revan from the destruction and formed a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Bond\|Force Bond]] with him to save his life. 

The Jedi Order wiped Revan's memories, replacing them with a new identity as a Republic soldier stationed on Bastila Shan's warship. He went on to retrain as a Jedi under the Jedi Councils guidance and to join the war against [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Darth Malak]] with Bastila. 

After capture by [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Darth Malak]], Revan's real identity was exposed and Bastila was lost when they eventually escaped from the ship. Revan went on to try to complete their mission alone, only to be confronted with [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Darth Malak]] and a fallen Bastila. 

Revan was able to bring Bastila back to the Light and together they destroyed [[Characters/Darth Malak\|Darth Malak]]. Afterwards, he was given the title *Prodigal Knight* and he once more was considered a hero among the Jedi. 

Nevertheless, his legacy is a dark one. The remains of his empire went on to form the [[Organizations/Sith Triumvirate\|Sith Triumvirate]] and many other Sith cults, including the fanatical Order of Revan, and it was his holocron that inspired Darth Bane to develop the [[Library/Rule of Two\|Rule of Two]] philosophy. His fall to the Dark side was also used as a cautionary tale in the later Jedi Order's teachings. 

Some historians claim that there was yet another chapter to his life, several years after his marriage to Bastila and the birth of their children, in which Revan was captured by the Sith Emperor once more and tortured for over three hundred years. Some evidence suggests that he turned to the Dark once more, leading the Order of Revan, but there are also  accounts of him fighting with the Jedi and helping defeat the Sith Emperor once and for all. Many point out that Revan can't possibly be attributed with helping either the Sith or the Jedi at that time, as he wouldn't have survived for three hundred years, and others suggest that a different Sith took on the name Revan, not unlike the Darth Rivan who would arise much later.
