## Combat

Hazel's style has a heavy emphasis on defense. Her movements are notably swift, fluid, and acrobatic ([[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]] influence). With her double-bladed saber, she begins to balance her offense and defense with [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Form V]]. 

### Forms

Hazel specializes in [[Forms & Martial Arts/Soresu (III)\|Soresu (III)]] initially, but she later grows into [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru (IV)]] and, with her new double-bladed saber, begins to favor [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Shien / Djem So (V)]], using both sides simultaneously.

## Weapons

### Quarterstaff

Hazel's first weapon is her quarterstaff, a light-weight durasteel melee weapon crafted out of the wreckage on Jakku. It is simple in design, with cloth scraps bound around the grip and rounded blunt edges. It was destroyed during the [[Events/Battle of Medth\|Battle of Medth]].

### Borrowed Saber

Hazel's first lightsaber is one borrowed from [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]], formerly belonging to Jedi Padawan [[Characters/Octavia Bonteri\|Octavia Bonteri]]. It has a copper hilt with a rosy sheen, rather basic in structure but notably engraved with waves, with a deep indigo-blue blade produced by the [[Crystals/Ankarres Sapphire\|Ankarres Sapphire]] that powers it. The saber is capable of strengthening [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force healing\|Force healing]] and can only be wielded by a Lightsider.

### Jedi Sabers

Hazel's first Jedi lightsaber is designed with a white-silver hilt stylized for a comfortable grip and two-handed holds as necessary. It is powered by a violet [[Crystals/Windu's Guile\|Windu's Guile]] crystal, a rare type of Hurrikaine cystal. 

Her second Jedi lightsaber is crafted to interlock with the first at the hilts, allowing her to either create a saber-staff from her lightsabers or to dual-wield with them separately. This lightsaber has a golden hilt and a white, pearlescant blade produced by a [[Crystals/Krayt dragon pearl\|Krayt dragon pearl]].
