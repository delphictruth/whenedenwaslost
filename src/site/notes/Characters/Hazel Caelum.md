### Weapons

#### Quarterstaff
Hazel's first weapon is her quarterstaff, a light-weight durasteel melee weapon crafted out of the wreckage on Jakku. It is simple in design, with cloth scraps bound around the grip and rounded blunt edges.

#### Borrowed Saber
Hazel's first lightsaber is one borrowed from [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]], formerly belonging to Jedi Padawan [[Characters/Octavia Bonteri\|Octavia Bonteri]]. It has a copper hilt with a rosy sheen, rather basic in structure but notably engraved with waves, with a deep indigo-blue blade produced by the [[Crystals/Ankarres Sapphire\|Ankarres Sapphire]] that powers it. The saber is capable of strengthening [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Force healing\|Force healing]] and can only be wielded by a Lightsider.

#### Jedi Sabers
Hazel's first Jedi lightsaber is designed with a white-silver hilt stylized for a comfortable grip and two-handed holds as necessary. It is powered by a violet [[Crystals/Windu's Guile\|Windu's Guile]] crystal, a rare type of Hurrikaine cystal. 

Her second Jedi lightsaber is crafted to interlock with the first at the hilts, allowing her to either create a saber-staff from her lightsabers or to dual-wield with them separately. This lightsaber has a golden hilt and a white, pearlescant blade produced by a [[Crystals/Krayt dragon pearl\|Krayt dragon pearl]].
