# Bacta
Bacta is an organic chemical substance that consists of gelatinous, translucent red alazhi and kavam bacterial particles that are mixed within a colorless, viscous fluid known as ambori. Bacta seeks out wounds and promotes rapid tissue regeneration while preventing the emergence of scar tissue. Bacta is often thought of as a "miracle fluid" and is effective against almost every type of injury and ailment across an incredible cross-section of species throughout the galaxy. It is considered the best medicine available anywhere, replacing the previously used [[Fauna & Flora/Kolto\|kolto]].

Bacta is often used in bacta patches, salves, and bacta tanks. It can be synthesized with various levels of potency. 
## Ashern bacta
Ashern bacta is a strand of contaminated bacta created by the Ashern in approximately [[Events/Timeline\|7 BBY]] in an effort to combat bacta cartels. This contaminated bacta causes bacta allergy in anyone who comes into contact with it. 

Although the last of the contaminated batches seem to have been eradicated, [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]] once discovered one of the last known (possibly *the* last known) shipments of Ashern bacta while on a mission. She subsequently developed a bact allergy and must use [[Fauna & Flora/Kolto\|kolto]].
