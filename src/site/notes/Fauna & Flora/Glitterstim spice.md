# Glitterstim spice

Glitterstim is a rare variety of the drug family "spice" that is mined exclusively on [[Navigational/Planets/Kessel\|Kessel]]. It gives the user a brief, pleasurable telepathic boost and heightened mental state. However, it is one of the most addictive of spices. 

It is produced from the webs of spice spiders and photoactive, so it must be mined in total darkness and packaged carefully to avoid accidental activation. It primarily only runs through the black market.
