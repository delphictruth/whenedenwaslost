# Kolto
Kolto is a liquid that can be found in the depths of the water on the oceanic planet [[Manaan\|Manaan]], known for its healing capabilities. Although it was a valuable entity in the era of the Jedi Civil War, it is incredibly rare and therefore costly. With the emergence of [[Fauna & Flora/Bacta\|bacta]], a more effective, cheaper, and easily synthesized healing agent, kolto use became all but non-existent. 

Kolto is most commonly applied through complete submersion in a kolto tank, but it was also used as a primary component of medpacs before [[Fauna & Flora/Bacta\|bacta]] became the more popular solution. 

Notably, [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]] must use kolto due to her [[Fauna & Flora/Bacta\|bacta]] allergy.
