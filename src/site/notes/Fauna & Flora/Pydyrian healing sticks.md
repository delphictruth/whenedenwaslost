# Pydyrian healing stick
A Pydyrian healing stick is an object made on the [[Navigational/Almania\|Almania]] moon, [[Navigational/Pydyr\|Pydyr]], with astounding healing capabilities. When rubbed against a surface, it foams, leaving a white residue behind. It was in use all through the galaxy before [[Fauna & Flora/Bacta\|Bacta]] became common, and some thought it was more effective than bacta.
