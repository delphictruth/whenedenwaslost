# Vulptex

A species native to [[Navigational/Planets/Crait\|Crait]], the Vulptex looks like a small fox with white, crystalline structures for fur. They look quite a bit like they are made from jagged crystal, or icicles, which is why they are also called crystal critters more colloquially. 

[[Characters/Versailles Cordelia\|Versailles Cordelia]] once had a pet Vulptex, very eary into the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] re-training year, but was forced to kill it.
