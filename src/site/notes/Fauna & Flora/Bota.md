# Bota

Bota is a rare planet species to very few planets in the galaxy, with most of the bota product sourced from [[Navigational/Planets/Drongar\|Drongar]]. It is a highly unique medicinal tool given that its effects for each species vary. Supposedly, it can give Jedi a stronger connection to the Force as well. It becomes useless very shortly after leaving its planet unless it is frozen in carbonite. 

It has been recorded as all of the following, depending on species and specific effect: antibiotic, antipyretic, narcotic, soporific, stimulant.
