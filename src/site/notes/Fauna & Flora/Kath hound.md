# Kath hound

Kath hounds are predatory, dog-like creatures native to the planet [[Navigational/Planets/Dantooine\|Dantooine]]. They are the size of large dogs, with shaggy fur and hoofed feet. They are relatively peaceful unless provoked.

There is one line of kath hounds known as *horned kath hounds*, which are more aggressive than the standard hounds. Very rarely there are albino horned kath hounds, which are the most aggressive and difficult to kill.

Notably, there are several (insulting) expressions in common slang based on the Kath hound, such as "son of a Kath hound," "runt of a Kath hound," and "Kath-mutt."
