# Followers of Palawa

The Followers of Palawa were an ancient group that studied the Force, notably having been involved in an ancient war with the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]. They developed the martial art of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ter채s K채si\|Ter채s K채si]] in order to combat the Jedi, after the Jedi destroyed their homeworld, [[Navigational/Palawa\|Palawa]], and they were forced to retreat to [[Navigational/Planets/Bunduki\|Bunduki]]. They also developed a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Palawa hibernation trance\|deep trance technique]] that allowed them to sleep for decades without aging, somehow tapping into the Force through meditation to do so. 

During the [[Events/First Great Schism\|First Great Schism]], many Followers joined the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Legions of Lettow\|Legions of Lettow]] under General Xendor. It is said that some remnants of the Followers still linger on Bunduki, in the form of hermits.
