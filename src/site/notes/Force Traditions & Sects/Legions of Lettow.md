# Legions of Lettow

The Legions of Lettow was one of the earlier breakaway sects of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] during the [[Events/First Great Schism\|First Great Schism]], forming under the command of General and Jedi Renunciate Xendor. It was birthed from the desire to explore some of the darker aspects of the Force, when the Jedi Order refused Xendor's request to open a new academy for such purposes. 

The academy that was created on [[Navigational/Planets/Lettow\|Lettow]] was a unique one, encouraging passion and the freedom of emotion to empower use of the Force. It drew on traditions such as the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Order of Dai Bendu\|Order of Dai Bendu]], the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Followers of Palawa\|Followers of Palawa]], the Kashi Mer [[Force Traditions & Sects/Guardians of the Breath\|Guardians of the Breath]], the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Baran Do\|Baran Do]], and the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Chatos Academy\|Chatos Academy]], creating a swirling mix of teachings and practices that nevertheless still echoed the basic tenants of the Jedi. 

Notably, the Legionnaires are credited with developing [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman (VI)]] from the ancient [[Forms & Martial Arts/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai]] dueling techniques, naming the Form after the triumvirate of Kashi gods. 

The Legionnaires enterd into open war with the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] in apprxomimately 24,500 BBY, though it is unclear if the Legionnaires attacked first or if the Jedi declared war on the Dark Legions. Their leader, General Xendor, was defeated in a battle on [[Navigational/Planets/Columus\|Columus]] and still has his final resting place there.
