# Baran Do

The Baran Do was a Force tradition among the [[Kel Dor\|Kel Dor]] race of [[Navigational/Planets/Dorin\|Dorin]], the practitioners of which were called Sages. They acted as advisors and seers to the leaders of the Kel Dor society, using the Force to amplify their natural senses and detect dangerous weather phenomena in advance. They were also able to see into the future through their meditations, which was essential in preventing wars and stopping catastrophes long in advance. 

Although the Sages faded to near extinction following the rise of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], they managed to survive in their obscurity, unaffected by the [[Events/Great Jedi Purge\|Great Jedi Purge]].
