# Abeloth
Abeloth, once known as *the Servant*, was a mortal [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] who served [[the Ones\|the Ones]]. With some time she became *the Mother*, keeping the peace between the Father's warring Son and Daughter and helping establish harmony in the Force. However, in fear of her own mortality and losing her beloved family, she drank from the [[Font of Power\|Font of Power]] and bathed in the [[Pool of Knowledge\|Pool of Knowledge]] to gain immortality. Though she succeeded, her actions corrupted her with Darkness and she became the being known as Abeloth.

Abeloth was abandoned and imprisoned by the Son and Daughter for her betrayal. Whenever the Current of the Force was altered and the flow of time changed, she was able to escape her prison, and every time she escaped the Son and Daughter would return to defeat and imprison her once more.
