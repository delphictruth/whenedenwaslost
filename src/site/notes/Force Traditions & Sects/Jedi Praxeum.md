# Jedi Praxeum

The Jedi Paxeum was established by Grand Jedi Master [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]], in the hope of establishing the [[Force Traditions & Sects/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]]. She and Jedi Master [[Characters/Rathos Visio\|Rathos Visio]] worked to find students and train them in the way of the Jedi on [[Navigational/Planets/Yavin 4\|Yavin 4]]. 

In the end, they only had four [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum#Jedi Padawan Classes\|Jedi Padawan Classes]] before the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]] in [[Events/Timeline#28 ABY — Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|28 ABY]], and only three of those had graduated to Knights.

## Jedi Padawan Classes
Traditionally, Jedi Padawans are trained as a collective. At the Praxeum, Padawan are sorted into classes based on approximate level of training — this serves as an easy way not only to establish different duties and lessons by class, but to have pre-determined group for combat drills. 

Classes are trained to deploy as a collective, or as smaller strike teams comprised of classmates. The general thinking behind this methodology is to prepare Padawans to work closely with one another and to grow deeply familiar with their potential combat partners.

Classes generally graduate as one as well, which is why they are sorted based on training progression and not by age. It is highly unusual for a single Padawan to be Knighted, and it typically doesn't happen. Padawans who are ready to be Knighted early will nevertheless stay with their class until their class's [[Library/Traditions/Knight Ceremony\|Knighting]].

Some classes are Knighted early, on account of special circumstances; typically anything that rises to the level of justifying an early Knighting is something that would have involved the whole class, so the class's graduation as a collective remains proper.
