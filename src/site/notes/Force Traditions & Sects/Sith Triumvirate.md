# Sith Triumvirate
The Sith Triumvirate formed out of the remains of [[Characters/Revan\|Revan]]'s Sith Empire following the end of the Jedi Civil War and Revan's return to the Jedi, otherwise known as the beginning of the Sith Civil War. Under the leadership of the Dark Lords of the Sith Triumvirate, it went on to wage war against the Jedi.

It operated out of the Trayus Academy on [[Navigational/Planets/Malachor V\|Malachor V]]. After [[Characters/Darth Nihilus\|Darth Nihilus]] and [[Characters/Darth Sion\|Darth Sion]] betrayed their master and fellow Lord, [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Darth Traya]], the Triumvirate went on to orchestrate the First Jedi Purge.

All three Dark Lords were said to perish on [[Navigational/Planets/Malachor V\|Malachor V]] and Trayus Academy was destroyed with them. The Triumvirate began to crumble, with the Sith Civil War reaching a peak, until the anarchial factions of Sith weakened them so severely that the Jedi were able to defeat them at last. Their downfall marked the end of the Sith Civil War. 

**Dark Lords of the Sith Triumvirate**
- [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Darth Traya]], Lord of Betrayal
- [[Characters/Darth Nihilus\|Darth Nihilus]], Lord of Hunger
- [[Characters/Darth Sion\|Darth Sion]], Lord of Pain
