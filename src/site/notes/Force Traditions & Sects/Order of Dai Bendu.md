# Order of Dai Bendu

The Order of Dai Bendu was one of the many ancient and semi-legendary organizations that studied the Force in the Early Hyperspace Age, prior to the birth of the [[Organizations/Galactic Republic\|Galactic Republic]]. It was headquarted in the Andobi Mountains of [[Navigational/Planets/Ando Prime\|Ando Prime]]. It was a significant influence in the birth of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Je'daii Order\|Je'daii Order]] and its successor, the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Holy Order of Jedi Knights\|Holy Order of Jedi Knights]], but the Order's tenants were poorly understood and their involvement in that birth was slowly forgotten. Some historians do still consider the Bendu monks to be the first incarnation of the Jedi.
