# Nihil

The Nihil were an anarchistic group of marauders from the [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]] who came to prominence and claimed territory as their own during the High Republic Era. They have access to mysterious hyperspace routes known as *Paths* that defied conventional hyperspace logic and allowed the Nihil to travel through hyperspace in unique ways that no one else could replicate. This advantage made them an extremely deadly and unpredictable threat to the [[Organizations/Galactic Republic\|Galactic Republic]]. 

The Nihil's Paths could be accessed through their [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Path engine\|Path engines]].

### Origins

Originally known as the *Elders of the Path*, the Nihil contain the remnants of a disbanded ground known as the *Path of the Hand*. The Path was a Jedi-hating organization that worked to develop the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Path engine\|Path engine]] and to record their Paths.
