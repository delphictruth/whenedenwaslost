# Mecrosa Order
The Mecrosa Order was a dark side coven formed from and sworn to the House Mecetti, a powerful noble family on [[Navigational/Planets/Obulette\|Obulette]] who swore an oath to protect them with their lives from all who threatened it. 

During the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]], the High Lady [[Characters/Indigo Oceana\|Indigo Oceana]] of House Mecetti took control over the Mecrosa Order and ruthlessly pursued their enemies from rival Houses. The Order operated from an ancient castle on [[Navigational/Planets/Nyssa\|Nyssa]] until approximately [[Events/Timeline#1250 BBY â€“ 1230 BBY\|1320 BBY]], when the Order made enemies with Dark Lord [[Characters/Belia Darzu\|Belia Darzu]] following the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]]'s intrusion into the [[Navigational/Sectors/Tapani sector\|Tapani sector]]. 

Members of the coven were hunted and nearly halved by the Dark Lord [[Characters/Belia Darzu\|Belia Darzu]]'s Battlemaster [[Characters/Dark Lord Echko\|Echko Kaliya]], up until the High Lady challenged him to single combat. Although Echko defeated Indigo, he spared her and chose to join the Mecrosa Order. With his assistance, the Order poisoned the Dark Lord [[Characters/Belia Darzu\|Belia Darzu]] and assumed control over the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]], which it led from the fortress on [[Navigational/Planets/Tython\|Tython]].
