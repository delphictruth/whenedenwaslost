# Rodia
Rodia is a small industrial planet located in the [[Tyrius system\|Tyrius system]] of the [[Navigational/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]]. It is predominantly covered in rainforests, oceans, and swamps, with no truly dry land to speak of. Notably, it is the homeworld of the Rodian species and is known (humorously) as a major exporter of "bounty hunters".

The cities of Rodia are built on waterways and protected from the extreme humidity and moisture by environmental shields known as "bubble domes."
