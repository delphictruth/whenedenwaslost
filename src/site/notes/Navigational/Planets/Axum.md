# Axum

Axum is prominately known as the old throneworld of the [[Organizations/Azurian Nobility\|Azure Imperium]], a vast area of power that became the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Perlemian Trade Route\|Perlemian Trade Route]]. It is a strong industrial world with a large population, considered one of the [[Navigational/Regions/Core Worlds\|Core Worlds]]' mightiest urbanized worlds and a military stronghold. 

Axum is traditionally ruled by a monarchy, with their royal family originating from the ruling authority of the [[Organizations/Azurian Nobility\|Azure Imperium]]. The ruling Houses and minor nobility of other [[Navigational/Sectors/Azure sector\|Azure sector]] planets traditionally swear fealty to the royal family. For this reason, Axum is sometimes referred to as the *Azure Queen*. 

The last official heir of Beaumont, Crown Princess [[Characters/Cecily Beaumont\|Cecily Beaumont]], never rose to the throne. Axum practices rather particular and archiac traditions, such that a new royal family cannot actually ascend to the throne unless named by the prior house or else the throne goes unclaimed for 50 years. As an only child, Cecily left Axum with no obvious successor, and as such the planet still honors her as their heir apparent and protects the throne on behalf of House Beaumont in absentia. Some Axumites claim that she had a child and that the line of succession is in tact, only unvested. 

Axumites are known to be exceedingly formal and well-mannerd people, with a great pride in their history as a [[Core Founder\|Core Founder]] and the legacy of the [[Organizations/Azurian Nobility\|Azure Imperium]]. They have a great interest in the political and military history of the galaxy as a whole, and maintain the largest known library on the topic.
