# Exegol
Exegol is a dark, barren, and rocky planet with desert flats located in the [[Navigational/Regions/Unknown Regions\|Unknown Regions]]. Its dry conditions, combined with the rubbing of dust particles in its atmosphere, creates enormous static discharges that appeared as lightning strikes from the planet, which make the atmosphere too dangerous to deploy deflector shields. The desolate world is covered with enormous fissures that reach deep into its crust. 

These were excavated by Sith loyalists who were attempting to reach a transportative vergence they believed to lie beneath the surface. This belief may have been based on the writings of the Jedi writer Kli the Elder in [[Library/Ancient Jedi texts/Rammahgon\|Rammahgon]], which referred to Exegol as a "place of eternal life."

It was used as the staging area for the development of the [[Organizations/First Order\|First Order]].
