# Takodana

Takodana is a remote, neutral planet located in the [[Navigational/Sectors/Tashtor sector\|Tashtor sector]] of the [[Navigational/Regions/Mid Rim\|Mid Rim]] and a part of the [[Navigational/Regions/Western Reaches\|Western Reaches]]. It is a lush, forested planet with small lakes and prominent greenery. It's remoteness has made it a haven for fugitives, smugglers, and explorers, especially with Takodana Castle acting as an open port to spies and dubious travelers. 

It is a popular departure point with easy access to trade routes that connect to the [[Navigational/Regions/Inner Rim\|Inner Rim]] and [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]]. Those heading outwards towards the Outer Rim refer to it as the "last taste of civilization" while those heading inwards towards the [[Navigational/Regions/Core Worlds\|Core Worlds]] refer to it as the "last grasp of frontier living." 

It is located on the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Great Gran Run\|Great Gran Run]] and the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Biox Detour\|Biox Detour]].

### Takodana Castle

Takodana Castle, also referred to as *Maz Kanata's Castle*, is on the shore of Nymeve Lake and owned by the pirate [[Characters/Maz Kanata\|Maz Kanata]]. It is a fortress with a main hall that hosts a cantina, as well as a large underground network of dungeons, storerooms, and catacombs.
### Lost Jedi Temple

The ruins of a Jedi Temple exist on Takodana, though they have been grown over by nature and have not been visited in decades. The Temple was destroyed by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Nihil\|Nihil]] during *Operation: Counterstrike* in the High Republic Era. 

## Plot Significance
