# Lettow

Lettow is something of a legendary "lost world," having drifted so far out of orbit in the millennia since its use that it is no longer where it was once. It is no longer found where the maps indicate that it should be — in the [[Navigational/Regions/Core Worlds\|Core Worlds]], not far from [[Navigational/Planets/Columus\|Columus]] — and there has no been no updated record of its location. The home and resting place of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Legions of Lettow\|Legions of Lettow]], the planet is marked by a nearly mythic history and some consider it only a legend.
