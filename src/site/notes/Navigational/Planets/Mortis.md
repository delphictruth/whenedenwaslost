- Also known as 
# Mortis
Mortis is an ethereal realm within the Force which is whispered over in legends and stories passed down through the millennia by Jedi, Sith, and the average spacer alike. It is believed to have existed outside any star system, and potentially the galaxy or even the universe. Some believe that the origins of the Force came from Mortis.
