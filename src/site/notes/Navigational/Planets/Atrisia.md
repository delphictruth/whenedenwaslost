More mordernly known as *Ketal Phard*, Atrisia is the heart of the [[Navigational/Sectors/Atrisian Commonwealth\|Atrisian Commonwealth]]. It is located on the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Giju Run\|Giju Run]]. 

Once a planet of several nations, Atrisia was unified under the Kital Phard Dynasty, giving rise to its more modern name. Later, the ... Dynasty took power and began referring to themselves as the Atrisian Empire once more, and then the Atrisian Commonwealth once the Atrisian Parliament was formed to aid the monarchy.
