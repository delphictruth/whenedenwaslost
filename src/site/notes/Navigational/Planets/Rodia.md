# Rodia

Rodia is a small industrial planet located in the [[Navigational/Systems/Tyrius system\|Tyrius system]] of the [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]]. It is predominantly covered in rainforests, oceans, and swamps, with no truly dry land to speak of. Notably, it is the homeworld of the *Rodian species* and is known (humorously) as a major exporter of "bounty hunters". 

The cities of Rodia are built on waterways and protected from the extreme humidity and moisture by environmental shields known as "bubble domes."

## Encheeko
Encheeko is the primary contintent on Rodia. 

### Iskaayuma
Iskaayuma is the current capital city of Rodia and located on the *Sika Peninsula* of the contintent Encheeko. It is a sprawling city with omnipresent thick smog from the hundreds of weapons factories stationed in its industrial zone. While there is a starport located in the city, most visitors are redirected to the [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Equator City\|Equator City]] spaceport. The city itself cradles [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Chatzza Bay\|Chatzza Bay]].

#### Eanca Goa-Ato
Also known as the *Grand Protector's Hunters' Guild Hall*, the Hall is a large complex of buildings located in the capital city. It is home to the Awards Hall and the Chronicle Room, both of which contain records of the bounty hunters of Goa-Ato. 

#### Rodmark Weapons Plant
The Rodmark Weapons Plant is one of the largest weapons factories located in Iskaayuma's industrial zone. It is notably known as the site of the *Rodmark Massacre*, a horrific incident in which over 100 workers were slaughtered in the factor. Most say that the Massacre was the product of dueling bounty hunter clans. 

#### Chatzza Bay
Chatzza Bay is along the *Sika Peninsula* of Encheeko and situated within the city Iskaayuma. It leads into the [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Ioliu Sea\|Ioliu Sea]].

### Matza
Matza is the smaller and much less significant city on the Encheeko contintent. Some reports refer to the city as *Yusk*, which is a known Rodian agricultural city. It is unclear if the two are in fact the same city, or merely located directly next to one another. 

## Betu
Betu is one of the two continents on Rodia. It is the smaller of the two but previously hosted the planet's content. The Rodians were said to relocate on account of increased flooding on Betu.

### Equator City
Equator City is a megalopolis that was previously the capital city of Rodia. It is located on the continent Betu. It is a known gambling complex that is said to have hosted various criminal syndicates over the years.

#### Flip of the Credit
Flip of the Credit is a casino located in Equator City. It is most famously known as a money laundering sceme for the [[Organizations/Black Sun\|Black Sun]].

#### Holosseum
A prestigious concert hall located in Equator City. It is a larger, half-egg shaped construction made of durasteel and transparisteel. It is apparently spacious enough to hold "at least 5 light freighters."

### Samana
Samana is the second city on Betu and almost entirely underwater. It is technically possible to land in Samana, but most control officers direct air traffic to the spaceport in [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Equator City\|Equator City]].

### Chekkoo Enclave
Home of the Chekkoo clan, the Chekkoo Enclave is large enough to be considered a city. It is protected by a strong wall and contains three other walled sections, meant to protect the clan tower. Residences and businesses lay within the walls, making it almost entirely self-sufficient. 

## Wesessa Sea
The Wesessa Sea borders [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Betu\|Betu]] and hosts the [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#An'yettu Islands\|An'yettu Islands]] and [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Wesessa\|Wesessa]]. 

### An'yettu Islands
The An'yettu Islands are an archipelago located in the Wesessa Sea. The reigning bounty hunter clan located on the island chain was prevented from expanding beyond their borders.

### Wesessa
Wesessa is a large island located north of Betu. 

## Ioliu Sea
The Ioliu Sea is one of Rodia's bodies of waters and is located off the coast of [[Navigational/Planets/Rodia#Encheeko\|Encheeko]]. It has nine large islands, the most prominent of which is Itugua. 

### Itugua
Iutuga is a large island located in the Iuliu Sea. The island is covered with jungle and thick underbrush and there are few trails. In the center of the island is a grouping of hills containing several caves. There are also several rivers flowing into the sea from the center of the island.
