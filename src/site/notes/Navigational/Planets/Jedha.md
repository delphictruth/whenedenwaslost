# Jedha
Jedha is a small desert moon that orbits the plant [[Navigational/Planets/NaJedha\|NaJedha]] in the [[Navigational/Sectors/Terrabe sector\|Terrabe sector]] of the [[Navigational/Regions/Mid Rim\|Mid Rim]]. It is situated on the trade route [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Burke's Trailing\|Burke's Trailing]].

The moon has a cold climit due to its lasting winter, yet features deserts and magma seas. 

The historical and spiritual significance of Jedha led the moon to become a world of worship for those who believed in the Force, and a holy site for pilgrims who sought spiritual guidance.
