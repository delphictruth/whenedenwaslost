# Christophsis

Christophsis is a crystalline world in the [[Navigational/Sectors/Savareen sector\|Savareen sector]] of the [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]] territories located along the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Corellian Run\|Corellian Run]]. It is orbited by a single moon in the middle of a mineral-rich astroid field and is frequently struck by stray rocks from the various nearly astroid belts. Nevertheless, it was developed into a thriving mining hub around 600 [[Directories/Timeline\|BBY]]. Christophsis became a mjaor exporter of minderals, artwork, and industrial goods.

Christophsis was seized by the [[Organizations/Confederacy of Independent Systems\|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the [[Events/Clone Wars\|Clone Wars]] and subjugated to Separatist rule. Then a Jedi-led faction was deployed to the planet by the [[Organizations/Galactic Republic\|Galactic Republic]], and while the planet was eventually liberated, it also sustained significant damage and saw a sharp decline in exports.

## Chaleydonia

Also known as "Crystal City," Chaleydonia is the capital of Christophsis and informally treated as the capital of the [[Navigational/Systems/Christoph system\|Christoph system]]. It appears to be carved out of glittering gems, on account of the majority of its buildings, and notably the skyscrapers, being built with crystals. The city can be seen from space as a green, glittering network of branches.
