# Aeos Prime

Aeos is a terrestial planet covered in vast oceans located in the [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]] territories, home to the aquatic [[Species & Cultures/Aeosian species\|Aeosian species]] and [[Fauna & Flora/Krakavora\|krakavora]]. It is surrounded by a planetary ring. The surface is covered by a number of small islands, rocky caverns, and underground tunnels. It is ruled by a queendom. 

During the [[Events/Galactic Civil War\|Galactic Civil War]], Aeos hosted a [[Organizations/Rebellion\|Rebellion]] outpost that was subsequently abandoned at the end of the war. This outpost was later re-discovered and re-purposed by the crew of the space station [[Navigational/Space Stations/Colossus\|Colossus]] while they were defecting from the [[Organizations/First Order\|First Order]] in [[Events/Timeline#31 ABY\|31 ABY]].
