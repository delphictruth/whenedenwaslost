# Kashi

Kashi was an [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]] planet that was once the home to the ancient, isolationist [[Species & Cultures/Kashi Mer\|Kashi Mer]] civilization, the Kashi Dynasty, and to the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Guardians of the Breath\|Guardians of the Breath]]. However, Kashi's sun suddenly and inexplicably exploded in a supernova, destroying the entire system and essentially wiping out the Kashi Mer culture.
