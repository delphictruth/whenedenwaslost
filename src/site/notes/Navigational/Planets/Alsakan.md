## Xenvaer

Xanvaer is the capital of Alsakan, marked by ancient wealth and glamorous buildings. Unlike the rest of the planet, this city has not been modernized: there is no air traffic in the capital proper, with heavy restrictions on the airways. Instead, the city is a walking one, with no speeders on the ground either. Nevertheless, its ancient architecture is glorious. 

### Xenvaer Civic Auditorium

The site of the Refugee Relief Movement fundraiser, which is typically hosted every other year (or more frequently during war times).
