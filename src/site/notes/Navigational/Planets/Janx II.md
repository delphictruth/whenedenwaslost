## Boxer Point Station

Boxer Point Station is a huge multi-purpose space station that operates almost entirely independently of its home planet. While predominately known as a smuggler market, it has also been used as an emergency [[Organizations/Rebellion\|Rebellion]] outpost in the past and is currently used as a rendezvous point for the [[Organizations/Resistance\|Resistance]]. Most credit this relationship to [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]]'s smuggling history. Notably, *Sennifer's Beam and Balance* is a famous cantina and bar located on the station.
