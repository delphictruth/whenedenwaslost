# Coruscant
Coruscant is a planet located in the [[Navigational/Regions/Core Worlds\|Core Worlds]], at the center of numerous major hyperlanes and essentially the center of the galaxy itself. It has developed into an ecumenopolis over the centuries, with a total of 5,127 levels of the city built up from the surface by the time of the [[Events/Clone Wars\|Clone Wars]]. The actual planet-wide metropolis is called Galactic City, which is considered the planet's capital. 

Coruscant has historically been the most politically important world in the galaxy, hosting the capital of almost every major government system for millennia. Even when the [[Organizations/New Republic\|New Republic]] had its rotating capital, Coruscant was still considered the center of the Republic and the most politically relevant planet. 

As the essential center of the known galaxy, Coruscant appears on the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Corellian Run\|Corellian Run]], [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Coruscant-Dantooine hyperlane\|Coruscant-Dantooine hyperlane]], [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Koros Trunk Line\|Koros Trunk Line]], [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Martial Cross\|Martial Cross]], [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Metellos Trade Route\|Metellos Trade Route]], [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Perlemian Trade Route\|Perlemian Trade Route]], and [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Shawken Spur\|Shawken Spur]].

## Galactic City
Galactic City is the current name for the planet-wide metropolis that covers the surface of Coruscant. Over the centuries it has gone by several names, including *Republic City*, *the City of Spires*, *Imperial City*, and *New Republic City*. The Senate District, sometimes referred to as the Senate Sector, is more specifically the *de facto* capital of Coruscant and the central government center. 

*"Seen from orbit, Imperial Center is a blaze of light and sparkling colors, reminding some spacers of corusca stones, after which this planet was named long ago."* â€” Pollux Hax, aid to Galactic Emperor Palpatine
