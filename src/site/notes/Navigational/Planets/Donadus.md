# Donadus
Donadus is a small, rather barren planet in the [[Navigational/Regions/Inner Rim\|Inner Rim]]. It appears red and yellow from space, with a surface made up almost entirely of flat deserts. It is not known for much, other than a temporary base for smugglers, but a group of pirates known as the Chorran shipjackers used to operate out of Donadus. The pirates were routed by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] in [[Events/Timeline#31 ABY â€“ [When Eden Was Lost (Ao3)](https //archiveofourown.org/works/19334440)\|31 ABY]].
