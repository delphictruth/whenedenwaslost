# Medth
Medth is a mid-sized planet covered in marshes and shallow waters. The air is thickly humid, giving the impression of the entire planet being wet in some way or another. There are several dark forests spread across the planet's surface, rising out of the marshlands. It is located along the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Rimma Trade Route\|Rimma Trade Route]].
