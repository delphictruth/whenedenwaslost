# Castilon

Castilon is an ocean planet located near [[Navigational/Regions/Wild Space\|Wild Space]] in the [[Navigational/Regions/Mid Rim\|Mid Rim]]. It is far enough out that it is described as being "on the edge of nowhere." It is the homeworld to the [[Species & Cultures/Chelidae species\|Chelidae species]] and several unique sea creatures. The surface is covered almost entirely with oceans, dotted with a few isolated islands. The planet is orbited by two moons.
