# Akuria

Akuria is an ice planet not far from the planet [[Navigational/Dantooine\|Dantooine]]. It is a snowy, arctic tundra home to the native [[Species & Cultures/Snow Stompers\|Snow Stompers]]. It was the site of a [[Organizations/Rebellion\|Rebellion]] outpost, following the defeat of an [[Organizations/Galactic Empire\|Imperial]] base that was housed there originally. In more recent years, the outpost has been used by the [[Organizations/Resistance\|Resistance]] as an undetected base of operations.
