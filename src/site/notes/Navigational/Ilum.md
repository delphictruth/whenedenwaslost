# Ilum
Ilum is an ice planet in the [[Navigational/Unknown Regions\|Unknown Regions]] and one of the main sources of [[Crystals/Adegan\|Adegan]] crystals. There are expansive caverns underground that were developed into a Jedi temple, which allowed the Order to host the [[Library, Philosophies, Teachings/Gathering\|Gathering]] in the Crystal Caves. For that reason, it was one of the primary sources of lightsaber crystals for the Order as a whole and considered to be a sacred site to the Jedi. 

Notably, Adegan crystals from Ilum only produce blue, green, and purple blades.
