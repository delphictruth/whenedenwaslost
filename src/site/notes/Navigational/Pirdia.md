# Pirdia
Pirdia is a gas giant that orbits the sun of the [[Navigational/Tyrius system\|Tyrius system]] in the [[Navigational/Savareen sector\|Savareen sector]] of the [[Navigational/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]]. It has 11 moons. Notably, gas miners once discovered a long-abandoned fortress in the atmosphere, named the *Sky Fortress*, but there are very few actual records of its existence.
