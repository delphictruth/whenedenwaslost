# Alderaan

Occasionally called the *planet of beauty*, Alderaan is a terrestial planet covered with vast bodies of water and snow-capped mountains. It is one of the oldest founding members of the [[Organizations/Galactic Republic\|Galactic Republic]] and was a crucial actor in the [[Organizations/Rebellion\|Rebel Alliance]]. It is ruled by the [[Organizations/Alderaanian Monarchy\|Alderaanian Monarchy]].

There are a variety of grapevines that do well in Alderaan's natural climate, allowing the production of Toniray and emerald wine. The planet is also home to the Alderaanian wolf-cat. 

The cities of Alderaan are carefully designed to respect the natural beauty of their environment. Alderaanian architecture makes use of white synthstone, which inspired the dreamy look of Cloud City.
