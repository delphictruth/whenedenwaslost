# Kessel Run
The Kessel Run is a 20-parsec route used by smugglers to move [[Fauna & Flora/Glitterstim spice\|glitterstim]] from [[Navigational/Kessel\|Kessel]] without getting caught by ships guarding the movement of spice from Kessel's mines. It is not to be confused with the [[Navigational/Kessel Trade Cooridor\|Kessel Trade Cooridor]], the official route to Kessel.
