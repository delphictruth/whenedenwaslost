# Colossus

The *Colossus* is a mobile aircraft refueling station originally developed by the [[Organizations/Galactic Empire\|Galactic Empire]] and based on [[Navigational/Planets/Castilon\|Castilon]]. It was later under [[Organizations/First Order\|First Order]] control, with its crew defecting to the [[Organizations/Resistance\|Resistance]] and hiding the space station on [[Navigational/Planets/Aeos Prime\|Aeos Prime]]. 

It is a supertanker fuel depot that can operate in maritime environments as well as in space. It has a large, dagger-like structure, with a vertical design that ensures that only the upper levels of the station are visible when the station is immersed in water. 

It hosts a repair station, marketplace, and the Office of Acquisitions, among other things. The Doza Tower was the very top of the station, where the station's administrators and the elite racing and defense squadron, Ace Squadron, lived.
