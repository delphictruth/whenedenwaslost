# Christoph system
Located in the [[Navigational/Savareen sector\|Savareen sector]] of the [[Navigational/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]], the Cristoph system borders the [[Navigational/Corellian Run\|Corellian Run]] and is home to very few planets. 

The Christoph system features several asteroid belts, with three being the most prominent. Those are *The Barren* (which orbits the system's sun, Christoph), *The Hammers* (located between Christophsis and Erodsis), and *The Halo* (located beyond Erodsis).
