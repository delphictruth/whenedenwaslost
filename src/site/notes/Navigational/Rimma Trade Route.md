# Rimma Trade Route

The Rimma Trade Route is a major trade route that crosses a large portion of the galaxy. It starts in the [[Navigational/Core Worlds\|Core Worlds]] and reaches far into the [[Navigational/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]] territories. With a Class 2 hyperdrive, it is estimated that traveling the full length of the route would take at least six weeks. It transitions into [[Navigational/Trition Trade Route\|Trition Trade Route]], a continuation of Rimma.
