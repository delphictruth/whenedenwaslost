# Jedi Archives
The Jedi Archives was the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]'s repository of knowledge on [[Navigational/Planets/Coruscant\|Coruscant]] and rumored to hold the sum total of all galactic knowledge. Incredible amounts of data were stored electronically and holographically; whether or not the "sum total" of all knowledge actually was collected there, it was in fact the single largest source of information in the galaxy at its height. It contains data tapes, holobooks, [[Library/Holocrons/Holocron\|holocrons]], some special objects, and all manner of information storage devices. 

The Archives also contained profiles for each member of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], including profiles of all known and recorded past members, as well as profiles for known and wanted criminals. These records, along with the [[Library/Holocrons/Holocron\|holocron]] vault, were accessible only by Jedi and typically only with authorization or permission from a Jedi Master. 

Jedi of all ages and ranks used the Archives to study for tests, prepare for assignments and missions, and pursue personal curiosities. Following the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]] and collapse of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]], however, the Archives were ransacked and abandoned. Many of the vaults of ancient knowledge were sealed by the Archivists prior to invasion and are said to still be locked, forever inaccessible, but it is unclear if those vaults still exist or if they did withstand attempts to break in.
