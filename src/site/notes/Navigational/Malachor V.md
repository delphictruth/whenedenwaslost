# Malachor V
Malachor V, or simply *Malachor*, is an Outer Rim planet located in the Malachor system. During the [[Battles, Major Events, Wars, Eras/Battle of Malachor V\|Battle of Malachor V]], the planet was devastated by the use of the Mass Shadow Generator, with its very core cracking. Thousands of Jedi, Republic soldiers, and Mandalorians died in the resulting cataclysm. 

It is presently a cracked and twisted wasteland covered with jagged cliffs and plagued by constant lightning storms. Some refer to it as a "ship graveyard," given the broken and destroyed vessels that still orbit the planet and litter the surface to this day. 

The destruction of the planet tore a [[Force Abilities, Force Phenomena/Wound in the Force\|Wound in the Force]], and the echoes of all of the pain, suffering, and death resound strongly on the planet's surface. The gravity of the planet has become unstable, with the planet frequently pulling nearby starships out of orbit or disrupting hyperspace travel.

While the planet cannot sustain much life, it is inhabited by monstrous storm beasts and Sith creatures. It is said that prolonged exposure to the surface can be a corruptive force.

The planet's infamy has led its name to become a curse of sorts; many refer to "Malachor" in the same manner as "Hell".

**Notable Locations**
- True Sith academy ruins
- Trayus Academy

### Sith on Malachor
Prior to the destruction of Malachor, and even subsequent to it, the planet was always considered a stronghold for various Sith empires, factions, and cults. 

The True Sith constructed the Sith academy on Malachor, the ruins of which are buried beneath shattered ships, and used the planet as their stronghold.

Those historians who believe there is a connection between the True Sith and the Sith Empire also claim that the Sith Empire first developed Tyarus Academy on Malachor, not Revan. All agree, at aleast, that the Sith Empire used the planet as a stronghold at one point. 

During the Jedi Civil War, Dark Lord Revan used Trayus Academy as a Sith base and took advantage of the planet's corruption to Turn captured Jedi Knights. He was able to convert hosts of Jedi into Dark Jedi and Sith Assassins for the Sith Empire. 

The Trayus Academy was also used by [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Darth Traya]], Darth Sion, and Darth Nihilus during the height of their power. Mixed reports suggest that all three Sith eventually died on Malachor, and at some point the Academy, previously still standing, was destroyed.
