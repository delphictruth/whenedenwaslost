# Zoph

Zoph was once a planet located in the [[Navigational/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]], home to the [[Crystals/Zophis\|Zophis crystals]] and one of the sites where Jedi Padawans were sent to search for their crystals. However, because of its crystalline core and the devasting but unstable resonance of the Zophis crystals, the [[Organizations/First Order\|First Order]] seized the planet for the Starkiller Base project.
