# Atrisia
More mordernly known as *Ketal Phard*, Atrisia is the heart of the [[Navigational/Atrisian Commonwealth\|Atrisian Commonwealth]]. It is located on the [[Navigational/Giju Run\|Giju Run]]. 

Once a planet of several nations, Atrisia was unified under the Kital Phard Dynasty, giving rise to its more modern name. Later, the ... Dynasty took power and began referring to themselves as the Atrisian Empire once more, and then the Atrisian Commonwealth once the Atrisian Parliament was formed to aid the monarchy. 

Given its lengthy history, Atrisia is considered a classic field of galactic historical studies. It is also known as the home planet of the [[Fauna & Flora/shredder bat\|shredder bat]], Emperor Tching's *[[Library/Sayings\|Sayings]]*, and an ancient style of dual-wielding sword-fighting technique named after their capital, [[Lightsaber Combat/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai]].  

[[Characters/Janelle\|Janelle]] is the current ruling authority, managing much of the nation's politics on account of her sick parents. Under her guidance, the Atrisia has become a silent partner to the [[Organizations/Resistance\|Resistance]].
