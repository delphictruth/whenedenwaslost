# Western Reaches

The Western Reaches denotes a region of the galaxy that is large and consists of relatively remote systems. It is beyond the [[Navigational/Rimma Trade Route\|Rimma Trade Route]], expanding steadily over time with the growth of the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Corellian Trade Spine\|Corellian Trade Spine]] and the [[Navigational/Hydian Way\|Hydian Way]] and subsequent overflow from the Southern Core and Trailing Sectors. It is somewhat removed from the politics of the Core Worlds given its distance from [[Navigational/Planets/Coruscant\|Coruscant]]. 

The Western Reaches is also considered a sort of collective of regions, with several of the major regions falling within its territories.
