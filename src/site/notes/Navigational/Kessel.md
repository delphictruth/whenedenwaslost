# Kessel
Kessel is a misshapen planet with a barren, rocky landscape. Its landscape is dotted with ancient tombs and ruins, many of which appear to be Sith in origin. It is considered an extremely valuable source for smugglers in particular, as the only planet known for having a natural supply of [[Fauna, Flora/Glitterstim spice\|glitterstim spice]] and [[Fauna, Flora/Coaxium\|coaxium]].

Many of its mines used to be worked by prisoners from the Kessel Prison located on the planet. Many were prisoners of war captured by the [[Factions, Cults, Cultures, Governments/Galactic Empire\|Galactic Empire]].

The [[Navigational/Kessel Run\|Kessel Run]] is the unofficial route from the planet, used to smuggle spice, while the [[Navigational/Kessel Trade Cooridor\|Kessel Trade Cooridor]] is the official hyperlane.

## Kessendra
Kessendra is the only settlement on Kessel and thus considered its capital by mere technicality. It is a small military town based just outside the Kessel Prison. In rather tasteless fashion, administrators of the prison named the streets to reflect the city's purpose, including Spice Mines Avenue and Slavelord Boulevard.

### Kessendra Stadium
Kessendra Stadium is a large open-air sports arena located on the outskirts of Kessendra. It is frequently used for gladiatorial war games, often with slaves from the spine mines or prisons from Kessel Prison forced into participation.
