## Stonia
Stonia is the capital city of Almania, with very little to actually show for its capital status. Ironically, the planet is outshined by its wealthier moons, resulting in much smaller populations in Stonia itself.

### Great Dome of Je'har
The Great Dome of Je'har is a large, temple-like building situated in the capital city of Stonia. It was the headquarters for the Je'har regime of the past.
