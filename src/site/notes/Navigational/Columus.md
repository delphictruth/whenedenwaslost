# Columus

Columus is a planet located in the [[Navigational/Core Worlds\|Core Worlds]] and the homeworld of the [[Species & Cultures/Columi species\|Columi species]]. It is a fairly isolated planet, with a limited population, with no significant geograhical features. In fact, the planet's surface is oddly flat, with a very shallow soil layer that makes growth difficult to the sparse plantlife. Otherwise, it is swamps and forests, but not much else. 

It is most known among Jedi as the sight of a significant [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] victory over the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Legions of Lettow\|Legions of Lettow]] during the [[Events/First Great Schism\|First Great Schism]].
