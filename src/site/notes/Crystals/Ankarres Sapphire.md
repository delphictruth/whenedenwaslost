# Ankarras Sapphire

The Ankarras Sapphire is a unique [[Directories/Lightsaber crystals\|lightsaber crystal]], the only one of its kind. It is a legendary stone with great healing powers, capable of being wielded by Lightsiders on its own but also able to be used in a lightsaber to strengthen the Jedi overall. It produces a dark blue blade, nearly indigo in color.

It is said that if a Darksider tries to wield the crystal, or any saber produced with it, it will burn their hands.
