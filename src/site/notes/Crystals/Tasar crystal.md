# Tasar crystal
Tasar crystals are vibrant crystals native to the planet [[Navigational/Planets/Tasariq\|Tasariq]]. The stones were first formed in the early days of the planet, when a cataclysmic meteor shower hit the planet and nearly wiping out the Tasari people. As a result, the crystals were revered by the Tasari as objects of great power, and blood sacrifices would be performed in hopes of unlocking the mystical magic that supposedly resided deep within the tasar crystals. These crystals have never been used to power a lightsaber, however.

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Tasari had all but abandoned these archaic rituals, but most Tasari families still possessed some tasar crystals as important heirlooms. There were even some bands of Tasari which still believed in the power of the crystals as a type of healing magic. When civilized society came to Tasariq, the crystals became a valuable commodity and were sometimes used as a currency. 

The crystals come in a variety of colors, with each variety supposedly possessing a different level of power or specific use. Increased mining of these crystals led to a steady depletion of their supply, with miners having to proceed deeper and deeper into the planet's crust to locate more crystals.
