# Allya's Exile

Allya's Exile is a powerful crystal that is rarely used in lightsaber construction. The crystal lends its blade an incredible burn affliction, often running significantly hotter than other crystals. It produces an incredible scarlet color said to reflect its unbelievably hot qualities. It was named after the Rogue Jedi, Allya.
