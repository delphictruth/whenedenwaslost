# Zophis
Originating from [[Navigational/Planets/Zoph\|Zoph]], Zophist crystals produce a devastating but unstable blade due to the crystals' unique resonance. Lightsabers made with Zophis crystals can carve through durasteel plating with ease, but suffer from vulnerability to fluctuations in power from their crystal core. This makes them a powerful but potentially dangerous choice for a lightsaber.
