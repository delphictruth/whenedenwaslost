# Tutaminis
*Tutaminis* is an umbrella term used to classify the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]]-based Force abilities related to energy absorption. While the formal terminology and training of *tutaminis* was taught by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], it is a neutral skill set that is practiced by most Force-based groups to varying degrees. Similarly, although it was taught to all Jedi in the very early stages of their training, successfully dissipating highly concentrated energy (such as that of a blasterbolt or lightsaber blade) was considered a rare feat and a demonstration of the complete mastery of *tutaminis*. 

The skills associated with *tutaminis* rely on the concept that [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] can draw potentially harmful heat or electrical energy into their own bodies and diffuse or channel it away completely. It could be used to absorb various types of energy, including light, heat, radiation, and blaster fire. 

Skilled practitioners can use *tutaminis* techniques to dispel harmful energy-based Force attacks such as [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Lightning\|Force Lightning]]. Further, experts were able to utilize the healed energy to heal their own wounds or manifest other Force powers, essentially redirecting the concentrated energy to their own purposes. For this reason, some refer to it as the non-harmful version of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force drain\|Force drain]] techniques. 

[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force deflection\|Force deflection]] is commonly considered a form of *tutaminis*, wherein the user deflects energy-based threats (or even lightsaber blades) with their bare hands. Other uses include forming energy fields that can deflect incoming energy attacks or drain the heat and energy out of such attacks.
