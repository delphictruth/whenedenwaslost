# Memory Walk
The Memory Walk, also known as *torture by chagrin*, is a Force technique that reaches into the mind and forces a target to relive their worst memories over and over again. This technique has been practiced by various Sith and Dark side factions for millennia and was prohibited by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]. 

Skilled practitioners can focus the Walk on specific memories, drawing upon a specific emotion that they invoke or emphasizing especially painful ones. Torture by chagrin could not only break a target's will, but it could drive a victim insane or break their spirit so severely that it killed them.

### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*
In **Book V**, [[Characters/Snoke\|Snoke]] takes [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] on a Memory Walk following [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]]'s escape from the *Finalizer* and instructs him to then take [[Characters/Roman Ange\|Feru Ren]] on one. Ani Ren later suppresses Feru's memory of the Walk, though Feru remains aware that one occurred.
