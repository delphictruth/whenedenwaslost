# Flow-walking
Flow-walking is an extremely rare ability practiced by [[Species & Cultures/Aing-Tii\|Aing-Tii]] monks. Practitioners of this technique surround their emotions to the Force and center themselves in its flow, transcending time itself in order to observe events in the past or future. Aing-Tii monks describe it as flowing along the currents of the Force and reading its intentions. 

Skilled practitioners can impose themselves upon the passage of time and begin to influence and change the course of the events that they observe. The limitation of this ability is innate to the Force, as certain pre-destined events and outcomes cannot be prevented through flow-walking.

*"When you drop a pebble into a river, what happens? There's a splash, and then the splash disappears. The splash is real, but the river doesn't change. It continues on just the same."* â€” Fragment from teachings contained in the [[Library/Holocrons/Telos Holocron\|Telos Holocron]]
