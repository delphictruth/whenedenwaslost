# Qâzoi Kyantuska
Qâzoi Kyantuska (literally "Suppress Thought" in Basic) is an ability developed through [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]] that grants the wielder the ability to control and influence the minds of anyone they choose. Practitioners utilize this power to dominate a single mind or a multitude of minds simultaneously. 

Affected individuals appear to be in a trance, hypnotically paralyzed and unable to control their own facilities. Practitioners can force their victims to end their own lives or commit any number of acts against the victims' will. A castor in physical contact with an individual will have a stronger connection and be able to overpower even the strongest of wills.

This ability has been replicated through traditional Force powers to some degree and is therefore similar to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Tricks\|Mind Tricks]]. However, the form practiced through [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]] is seemingly more primal and warped, and arguably stronger.
