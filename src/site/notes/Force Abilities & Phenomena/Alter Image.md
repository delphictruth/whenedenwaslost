# Alter Image
Alter image is a Force power that allows the user to alter their own personal features, such as the height, weight, skin color, facial features, sex, voice, and body shape. These changes will stay as long as the Force-sensitive keeps the power up, but will be dropped whenever the Force-user falls unconscious or simply looses concentration. 

However, other Force-sensitives skilled in [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force empathy#Receptive Telepathy\|Receptive Telepathy]] may see through this disguise, which results in a contest of skills between the two Force-users. The power becomes more difficult to use the less the Force-user knows about the person being imitated.

This is similar to the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Tricks#Force illusion\|Force illusion]] technique, *masquerade*.
