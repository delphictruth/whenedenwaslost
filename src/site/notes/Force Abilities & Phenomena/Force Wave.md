# Force Wave
A more powerful form of the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Push\|Force Push]], it is a wave of pure Force energy that pulses outwards from the user to knock back anything in the blast radius. 

This technique is also known as *Force Shockwave*, *Force Bomb*, or *Focus Shockwave* (typically based on the degree of power unleashed and range of the blast). It falls within the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Telekinesis]] category of powers.
