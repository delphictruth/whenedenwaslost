# Morichro
The ancient Jedi art of *Morichro* is a powerful but potentially fatal Force technique through which the user slows down the body functions of another being into mild catatonia or long-term suspended animation or, in the extreme, to extinguish life. It is a very rarely practiced technique and was even prohibited by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] for centuries. 

Similar to a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Hibernation trance\|Force trance]], *morichro* suspends biological functions, including breathing and heart rate. A trained *morichro* user can turn the technique upon himself, surviving without food, water, or even air for periods of over a year at a time. 

But unlike a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Hibernation trance\|Force trance]], it can also be turned on others, making it an effective way of subduing enemies. (This technique is sometimes compared to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Stun\|Force Stasis]], though *morichro* is significantly more dangerous.) However, failure to monitor a targeted opponent can render them permanently unconscious or cause them to die of dehydration or starvation.
