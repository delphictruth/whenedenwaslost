- Also known as *danger sense*, *Third Sight*
# Precognition
A deeper form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense\|Force sense]], more tuned towards sensing future events and premonitions, especially from objects. It is essentially the opposite power to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|Psychometry]], which senses the past. 

[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Precognition\|Battle Precognition]] is a heightened version of this technique, specially attuned to an active battle. 

Precognition can also be a lead-in to a specific technique called [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Shatterpoint\|Shatterpoint]], or the ability to perceiving particular shatterpoints or weakness in opponents (including weak points in the events occurring) and utilize them to "shatter" an opponent. 

The [[Species & Cultures/Chiss\|Chiss]] refer to this ability as *Third Sight*, and in their heightened form it allows them to navigate through hyperspace safely without hyperlanes. 

**Specialists**::
- [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]]

In **Book II**, [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] triggers a Force vision encompassing both [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|Psychometry]] and Precognition when she touches [[Characters/Cecily Beaumont\|Cecily Beaumont]]'s lightsaber.
