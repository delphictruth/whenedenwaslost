## Curato salva
*Curato salva* refers to the umbrella of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]]-based Force abilities related to self-healing. While it may be considered a variant of Force healing, *curato salva* teachings focus specifically on healing one's self; for that reason, some refer to Force healing as purely an external ability, healing others, and distinguish the two abilities. This is a more traditional view, however, and not widely practiced by modern [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]].
