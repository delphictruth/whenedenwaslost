- Also known as *Force Stasis*
# Force Stun
Force Stun is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|telekinetic]] Force power that can temporarily restrict and freeze movement. Although this ability is typically used against living beings and opponents, it can also be used to freeze energy-based attacks or energy-generated weapons such as blasterbolts or lightsaber blades. 
### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*
In **Book III**, [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] uses Force Stun to freeze [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] in place while he questions her. After confirming that she has seen the map to [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]], he knocks her unconscious with a weaker application of Force Stasis. 
## Force Stasis
*Force Stasis* is a more heightened form of Force Stun, wherein the user goes beyond stunning the target's mere physical movement and deadens their senses and perceptions as well. This does more than merely prevent movement; it can sense targets into a catatonic state, ranging anywhere from a waking coma to complete consciousness. Individuals in stasis generally cannot feel pain and might not be capable of feeling anything.
