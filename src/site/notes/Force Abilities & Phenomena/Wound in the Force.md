# Wound in the Force
A form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|Force echo]]. Such a wound is a catastrophic disturbance in the Force, caused by a traumatic event that weakened the very fabric of the Force in the area. They are often formed at the sight of massive loss of life, especially those that occur in a short period of time. The epicenter of such a wound is a Dark place, reverberating with echoes of the pain, terror, and suffering of the dead.

Wounds can also form inside of Force-sensitives, but it is a very rare occurrence and often results when the individual in question survived the creation of a Wound elsewhere. Some compare an internal Wound to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Fallout\|Fallout]].

A Wound is a deeper form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|Force echo]]: the ripples that spread from the creation of a Wound can be felt by Force-sensitives half-way across the galaxy. A Wound's echo also happens simultaneously, unlike the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|Psychometry]] echoes that linger, though the lesser echoes often crop up near or within Wounds as well. 

"_How could you ever hope to know the threat you faced when you have never walked in the dark places of the galaxy? Faced war and death on such a scale? If you had traveled far enough, rather than waiting for the echo to reach you, perhaps you would have seen it for what it was. There is a place in the galaxy where the dark side of the Force runs strong. It is something of the Sith, but it was fueled by war. It corrupts all that walks on its surface, drowns them in the power of the dark side—it corrupts all life. And it feeds on death._" — Jedi Master [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Kreia]] to the Jedi Council, speaking of Malachor V
