# Force Body
Force Body is a type of Force ability that allows a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] to push their body's endurance past a safe limit, ignoring and sacrificing their health and well-being in order to sustain their connection to the Force. A very powerful connection to the Force is required to use this ability, but successful use of Force Body will allow a practitioner to live through what would otherwise kill them. 

Otherwise, Force Body can be used to prevent the user from being severed from the Force. Its effects can be heightened when used in combination with [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Valor\|Force Valor]] or similar techniques, but a practitioner must be careful to avoid spreading their focus too thin.
