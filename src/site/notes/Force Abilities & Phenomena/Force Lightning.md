- Also known as *Storm of Midnight Fire*, *Guided Lightning*, *chain lightning*, *Dark Aura*, *Sith lightning*, *Electric Judgment*, *Emerald Lightning*
# Force Lightning
Force Lightning is a well-known Force ability used to blast dangerous electrical bolts, used almost exclusively by the Sith (and thus commonly known as *Sith lightning*). It is a form of raw elemental power, allowing the user to unleash storms of lightning from their fingertips, and relies heavily on manifestations of Dark energy. Although the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] generally prohibited its use, it was not necessarily exclusively a Sith technique and was even used openly by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Je'daii Order\|Je'daii Order]]. 

Force Lightning can render an opponent unconscious or kill them in short, powerful blasts. It has been known to burn the skin and cause extreme agony as well as severe physical damage, making it a popular torture device. 

It can also have insidious long-term effects, both on the target and on those who wield it. The lightning can burn skin, cripple and deform the body, and cause brain damage, blindness, chronic muscle aches, and seizures in targets, among other things. Intense and prolonged use of Force Lightning can also lead to the gradual disfiguration of the wielder, including the charring of the casting hand. 

Some skilled [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] can [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Tutaminis\|absorb]] or [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force deflection\|deflect]] Force Lightning.

While Force Lightning standardly appears blue, it can manifest in any number of colors and the color is generally unique to the practitioner or to their alignment with the Force. Recorded colors include blue, green, purple, red, white, black, yellow, orange, and gold, though some are much rare than others.

### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*

[[Characters/Snoke\|Snoke]] commonly employs Force Lightning against [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] in varying degrees of intensity. Occasionally *Force shocks* or *Dark Aura* are used just to issue a warning or act as a mild threat, but he also uses Lightning as a torture device.  
## Force shock
*Force shock* is a Force power that allows the user to create an energy spark that tracks and damages the nearest enemy. The shock can stun or injure target, or else used merely to track a target until the energy dissipates. These shocks are miniature forms of Force Lightning. 
## Force Storm
One variant of Force Lightning is known as *Force storm*, wherein the user creates an explosion of electrical energy directed at all foes in the vicinity. This is a specific application of lightning and therefore not the same as a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force storms\|Force storms]] or weather-conjuring applications of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Alter Environment\|Alter Environment]].
## Force Tempest 
*Force Tempest* is a variant of Force Lightning in which the user projects Force Lightning from all of their limbs in a whirlwind that encircles their body. Some practitioners will twirl around while using Force Tempest, turning their own bodies into tempests.
## Chain lightning
*Chain lightning* is an application of Force Lightning wherein the lightning creates a "chain" through targets, hitting first one target before moving to strike one or several others in a chain. It is a more complex technique that requires greater discipline and concentration to project and sustain the stream of lightning. Less skilled practitioners may chain weaker bursts of lightning, while more skilled practitioners can maintain an equal level of intensity for the duration of the bursts. 
## Lightning Shield
The *Lightning Shield* is a technique in which a shield of lightning is used to cover and protect the user. This Shield could be used to merely deflect energy-based attacks, such as Force Lightning itself, or to shock and stun opponents who try to cross the Shield. Some practitioners were able to float above ground while within the Shield or to enhance the intensity of their lightsaber's blade within its walls. 
## Dark Aura
*Dark Aura* is a form of Force Lightning that charges the air surrounding an opponent with malicious Force energy, damaging through around the user and slowing their movements. [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Darth Sidious]] is the most notable user of this specific technique. 
## Electric Judgment (Emerald Lightning)
*Electric Judgment* is a variant of Force lightning that was used by some Jedi Knights and Masters during the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]] era to launch a spray of green ("emerald") or orange bolts to stun or kill their enemies. Unlike most other forms of Force lightning, it could be fueled through feelings of justice or righteous anger, thus giving rise to the name *Electric Judgment*. It was more rarely practiced by members of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]].
