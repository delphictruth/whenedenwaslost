# Force Shield
Force Shield is a neutral offense and defensive Force ability that is used to create a barrier or wall of Force energy around an intended target (be it self, friend, or foe). It is a very basic application of the Force, commonly enhanced with [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Enlightenment\|Force Enlightenment]], and can be used in a variety of ways. These barriers are capable of absorbing physical and energy attacks based on the wielder's own stamina and capabilities; rarely, they can also be used to block mental attacks. Some shields will deflect and redirect projectiles as opposed to simply blocking them.

The shield generates by Force Shield manifests based on the individual. They can appear as shimmer stasis fields or be invisible to the naked eye, nearly transparent or opaque, and in varying degrees of apparent thickness.
