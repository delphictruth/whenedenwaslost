# Psychometry
Psychometry is the mirror image of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Precognition\|Precognition]]. It is a Force ability that allows the user to acquire information about people or events associated with an object or place solely by touching or entering it. Some users see a blinding white light before receiving a Force vision of the sight, sounds, and emotions associated with the object. These visions have varying degrees of clarity. 

Unlike other Force abilities, Psychometry cannot be cultivated or taught to Force sensitives. It is an innate skill that can only be honed and practiced by those who are born with the ability.
