# Breath control
The Force power breath control allows the practitioner to suppress the body's instinct to shut itself down after long periods without oxygen. This allows the user to be go without breathing for longer periods than is natural.

It is largely useful underwater, where the air is thin, or when the user is in toxic fumes. It can also be used to enter a healing coma of sorts.
