# Sith magic
Traditionally, Sith magic is an arcane expression of Force ability first developed and practiced by the original [[Species & Cultures/Sith species\|Sith species]] through which they manipulated the power of the Dark side. Although such magic has roots in Force manipulation, it is a much more innate and arcane connection. Practitioners rely on rituals, alchemy, spells, hand gestures, and Sith artifacts and amulets to perform their magic and channel the raw power of the Force's malignant side. 

Using Sith magic, practitioners were able to warp minds ([[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Q창zoi Kyantuska\|Q창zoi Kyantuska]]), alter the environment, and obliterate whatever obstacles stood in their way. Such abilities have been replicated by darksiders using more standard approaches to the Force: [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Tricks\|Mind Tricks]], [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Alter Environment\|Alter Environment]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Blast\|Force Blast]].
