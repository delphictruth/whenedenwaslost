# Force sense
Force sense is the most basic of Force abilities, allowing the user to feel another being's feelings, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]]. Generally when individuals refer to "[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitivity]]," they are referring to this innate ability, as it is considered a baseline level of Force ability. Every [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] is capable of some degree of Force sense, even if they are only capable of the most low-level of abilities. 

For this reason, "[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]]" is one of the main three [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force\|Aspects of the Force]] taught by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]. Although the two terms are not exactly interchangeable, many of the more advanced forms of Force sense fall under the Sense category. 

Advanced [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] can use the related abilities [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Precognition\|Precognition]] and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telepathy\|Telepathy]].
## Clear mind
*Clear mind* refers to the ability of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitives]] to conceal themselves from other Force-users who might be trying to sense them with the Force. This ability is essentially identical to the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]]-based [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Atlus sopor\|Atlus sopor]], only achieved through a different theory of thought and meditation that is based on [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]]. 
## Farsight (Clairvoyance, Force sight)
*Farsight* is the Force ability that allows a user to "see" their targets or any event happening without actually needing their eyes. It enhances the user's visual and spacial perception even in the dark or beyond walls, allowing them to acquire information information about a person, object, location, or event beyond the normal range of detection. It is a specialized form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense\|Force sense]] and sometimes referred to as *Force sight*, a term that is also used for Force sense generally.
