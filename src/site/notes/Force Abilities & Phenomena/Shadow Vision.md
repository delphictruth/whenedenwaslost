# Shadow Vision
Shadow Vision is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]]-based Force ability that enables the user to gain low-light vision, allowing them to ignore the concealment of darkness. It can also be used to see through Force-created concealment, such as that achieved through [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Atlus sopor\|Atlus sopor]] and similar techniques. It is a temporary ability but has the advantage of not requiring much energy to maintain. It is comparable to specialized uses of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense\|Force sense]].
