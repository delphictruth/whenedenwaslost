# Force Jump
Force Jump is a Force ability used to augment the user's natural leaping ability, allowing them to perform awe-inspiring vertical or horizontal leaps with impunity. The Force Jump is one of the most commonly used Force powers by [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] throughout history and is frequently used by [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] in combat to quickly cross the battlefield. 

Although it is considered a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]]-based ability, it is also one of the hybrid abilities within the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Alter\|Alter]] category because some users rely on [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Telekinesis]] to perform abnormal jumps.
