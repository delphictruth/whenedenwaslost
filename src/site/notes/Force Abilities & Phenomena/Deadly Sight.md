# Deadly Sight
Deadly Sight is a Force ability used primarily by Darksiders, in which the user harnesses their fury and hatred into deadly energy. In doing so, they project their hatred through an intense glare onto the victim, blistering skin and vaporizing extremities. As such, it is sometimes referred to as the *evil eye* by non-Force users.

Users of Deadly Sight can damage entire groups of foes within their field of vision. The drawback and risk of this technique, however, is that it will damage everyone in the user's line of sight â€” including allies and civilians. 

Attempts to refine its effects have largely been unsuccessful, though there may be little research involved given that the power has historically been used only by Darksiders. It is also extremely tiring to sustain and tends to be too inefficient for prolonged use. 

It used to be an extraordinary rare ability, but its usage exploded in the last decades of the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]]. As it became more prominent and known to the galaxy, the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] forbid its use or study by Jedi Knights.
