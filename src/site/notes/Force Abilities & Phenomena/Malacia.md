# Malacia
Malacia is a Force technique that is uses to induce a powerful dizziness and nausea in enemies by turning their equilibrium against them. It is completely incapacitating, but causes no damage to the body, and so is not considered a Dark side power. Even so, the effects of the power are sometimes so severe that it can cause a target to vomit. The principal quality of the technique is that a Force user utilizes it by transforming a target's energy rather than using their own.

Teachings relating to the practice of Malacia can be found in the [[Library/Holocrons/Great Holocron\|Great Holocron]], believed to be sealed within the closed vaults of the [[Navigational/Jedi Archives\|Jedi Archives]] on [[Navigational/Planets/Coruscant\|Coruscant]]. 

_"Imagine a sentry guarding a post that you must bypass. The sentry may be standing still, but his mind is alert and his systems are functioning. Everything is in motion. Blood flows, muscles tense, food is digested, and atmospheric gases are inhaled and exhaled. All that motion is enough to make him dizzy and queasy, and by focusing on that flow of blood, you can make that happen. The sentry will be so overwhelmed that he will be disabled, yet will suffer no permanent side effects."_ â€” Jedi Master Oppo Rancisis
