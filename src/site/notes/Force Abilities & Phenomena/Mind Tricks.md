# Mind Tricks
Mind tricks refer to a spectrum of Force powers that are capable of influencing the thoughts of sentient creatures. It is commonly used as a coercion method, or a way of persuasion, but it can be used to create sensory illusions or distractions, extract information, and push a target's thoughts in a certain direction.

## Force persuasion
A Force-user uses Force persuasion in order to exert influence over another's mind or emotions. It is a powerful form of suggestion. While it is used universally, it can be something of a moral debate for Light-side users and is commonly taught with restraint among the Jedi. It is also called *affect mind*, for milder uses, or *dominate mind*, for more extreme approaches (see *mind control*), in this form.

## Force confusion
Among the more advanced mind trick techniques was Force confusion, which could be used in combat to temporarily manipulate enemies to fight as an ally. It was especially useful when outnumbered, and was quicker to employ than affect mind in the heat of battle.

## Force fear
Force fear is a strictly Dark-side technique among mind tricks, used to strike fear into the deepest part of a target's mind and invoke uncontrolled fear. It can be used to demoralize, terrorize, and completely dissolve a target's courage. 

*Force horror* allows a Dark-siders to force multiple enemies into a catatonic state of panic that was more severe and more difficult to defend than basic fear. 

*Force insanity* also enables the Force user to affect multiple enemies at once, although to an even greater range than its predecessor. As the most advanced form of Force fear, its effect is much more devastating, with the victims possibly descending into an utter state of frenzied madness and deranged mania as their situation seems to suddenly become hopeless.

## Mind control
Mind control is sometimes considered the Dark-side version of mind tricks, although mind tricks are considered universal. Mind control is actually a much more invasive approach and requires taking complete control over the victim's mind. Skillful users can manipulate the thoughts and actions of their targets, as well as their memories, emotions, and senses. It is also called *dominate mind* and *control mind*.

## Force corrupt
Also called *Force corruption*, this is a Dark-side ability that can temporarily manipulate the minds of other sentient beings and make them serve one's own cause. It is something of a milder or less powerful form of *mind control*. It is known as a useful tool for turning enemies against their own allies during battle, but it's a short-term and limited effect.

## Mind Twist
Something of a niche technique, the Mind Twist refers to a skilled Force-user's ability to take someone's consciousness and twist their perception of reality to suit their needs. Practioners have convinced enemies that they are suffocating, or that they are on fire, etc. 

## Force illusion
Force illusions can be used to project various visions and images into the minds of others, specifically those within close range. This technique can be used to convince a whole crowd that they see something that is not there. 

A known variant of Force illusion was *masquerade*. Masquerade enables the user to project an image into a person's mind over the user, essentially masking the user's appearance. It is similar to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Alter Image\|Alter Image]].

The Dark-side technique for creating illusions, or *mindforms*, involves conjuring visible, life-like astral projections of whatever the conjurer desires through the use of Sith magic. The illusions distort all of an individual's sensory perceptions, and only through concentration on the Force is an individual able to perceive them as being false.

The [[Organizations/Fallanassi\|Fallanassi]], due to their abilities to manipulate the [[Organizations/Fallanassi White Current\|Fallanassi White Current]], were capable of creating powerful illusions. However, unlike most Force-sensitives, illusions created through the White Current could be created to be as insubstantial or as real as the user wanted, with the most convincing illusions being indistinguishable visually from a real object. Conversely, Fallanassi illusions could be intentionally insubstantial, so as to trick a sentient into thinking that something that was real wasn't real.

Similarly, the [[Organizations/Witches of Dathomir\|Witches of Dathomir]] use a unique style of Force illusions that tend to be central to their practice of magic. They call them *illusion spells*. 

## Force projection
Another possible variant of *Force illusion*, though not quite the same, is *Force projection*, which enables the user to create and "program" an apparition similar to themselves to distract, confuse, or lure enemies. The illusion can be animate or inanimate, is fully capable of intercepting incoming fire, and is visible to all around it.

 A similar ability that was primarily associated to the Dark side is *Force phantom*, which requires Sith rituals to tether the illusion created by the castor to a living creature, which will die if the illusion is destroyed.
