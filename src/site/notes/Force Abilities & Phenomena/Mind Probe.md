# Mind Probe
Mind probe is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telepathy\|telepathic]] ability of the Force that allows the user to sense or even sift through the thoughts, emotions, and memories of the victim, seeking useful information. It is very similar in nature to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force empathy\|Receptive Telepathy]], but is markedly more invasive, requires domination of the target's mind, and typically colored with anger and violence. This ability is also closely related to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Tricks\|Mind Tricks]].

**Specialists**::
- [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]]
### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*
In **Book III**, [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] uses a less invasive Mind Probe to confirm that [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] has seen the map to [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]]. Hazel describes it as a vague feeling of discomfort.

In **Book IV**, [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] attempts to use a Mind Probe against [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] to retrieve her memory of the map and the location of BB-8. However, she manages to resist him and ends up invading his thoughts instead. 

In **Book V**, [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] uses drain knowledge against [[Characters/Roman Ange\|Feru Ren]] to learn how to fly a starfighter for her escape from the *Finalizer*. She acquires his knowledge of flying and memories of being taught to fly by [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]]. 

In **Book XIII**, [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] uses drain knowledge to steal [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]]'s memories and knowledge of lightsaber combat. In doing so, she manages to acquire some proficiency with the [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru]], [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]], and [[Forms & Martial Arts/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo]] forms (though she uses Juyo more naturally and does not realize she has some of his training with it at the time). 
## Drain knowledge
Beyond simply reading of thoughts, the *drain knowledge* ability disrupts the Force to steal deep memories and information in a violent and merciless way. Such a process might damage the subject psychologically, though it is not always painful.
