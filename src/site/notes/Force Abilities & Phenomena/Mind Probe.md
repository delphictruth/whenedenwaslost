# Mind Probe
Mind probe is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telepathy\|telepathic]] ability of the Force that allows the user to sense or even sift through the thoughts, emotions, and memories of the victim, seeking useful information. It is very similar in nature to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Receptive Telepathy\|Receptive Telepathy]], but is markedly more invasive, requires domination of the target's mind, and typically colored with anger and violence. 

Beyond simple reading of thoughts, the *drain knowledge* ability disrupts the Force to steal deep memories and information in a violent and merciless way. Such a process might damage the subject psychologically.
