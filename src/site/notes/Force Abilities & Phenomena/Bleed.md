# Bleeding
Bleeding is the process that a darksider uses bends a [[Crystals/Lightsaber crystal\|lightsaber crystal]] to their will, turning it red. It can sometimes alter the properties of the crystal as well, but generally just re-attunes the blade to respond better to Dark side energy or else allows formly Light-only crystals to respond to a darksider.

The process requires the wielder to channel rage, hatred, fear, and pain into the crystal during focused meditation. It can be quite difficult, as the crystal typically resists the corruption, and sometimes can result in shattering or cracking the crystal. 

It is possible for some Light side users to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Purification\|Purification]] corrupted crystals, which would bring them back to the Light side and change their color. Sometimes the color would return to its old form, but usually the blades would become white. 

*"Since kyber crystals are naturally attuned to the light side of the Force, those who serve the dark side must follow a different path. First, they must seize a pure crystal from the lightsaber of a Jedi they have vanquished in combat—for the saber of a Sith is not given. It is taken. Then, they must infuse that crystal with their pain, anger, and hatred, bending it to their will. This corrupts the crystal, aligning it with the dark side and making it bleed with unbridled crimson power. The bleeding process can yield unpredictable results. Some crystals shatter, making their energies unstable and unpredictable. Others resist their realignment, refusing to be bent toward the darkness. Once a crystal has been properly bled, the primal power it releases becomes not only a deadly instrument in the hands of a Sith Lord, but a symbol of their true strength in the dark side.""* — [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Darth Sidious]]
