# Force Speed
Force Speed is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]]-based Force ability that enables the user to maintain sprinting speeds for a brief period of time. Skilled practitioners could use Force Speed to speed up both physically and mentally, with the mental application used to speed up their thinking and grant them "more time" to make decisions. Users are able to perceive and react to the world is slow motion, dodging attacks more easily and attacking more quickly with greater accuracy. For that reason, it is typically used in combat. 

Force Speed is also one of the most common abilities to be enhanced with [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Enlightenment\|Force Enlightenment]].
