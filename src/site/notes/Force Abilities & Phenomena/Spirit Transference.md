# Spirit Transference
Spirit Transference is a radical dark side Force power that can transfer an individual's consciousness into another body (or, in some cases, an inanimate object). Ancient Sith Lords and other powerful darksiders historically used this technique to cheat death, haunting their tombs as [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force ghost\|Sith ghosts]] and possessing those who stumbled across them. 

Typically, a completed transfer will destroy the practitioner's original body or vessel, especially in circumstances where they are attempting to assume the vessel of another living being. Powerful spirits can essentially "burn" the host's consciousness out of their body and claim it as their own. 
## Possession
The ancient Sith rituals historically used to complete a Spirit Transference would destroy the spirit's original body or whatever remained of it. Spirits who attempt a transfer after they have already become a ghost do not have a body to lose; as such, the ritual seemed to exact the physical "cost" of the transfer from the new host vessel. This could result in impairments or other injury to the targeted vessel, and in some cases it may even kill the vessel.

However, some [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force ghost\|Force ghosts]] are capable of achieving the life transfer without causing injury to the vessel or host body. Additionally, some living Sith were able to complete a Spirit Transference without destroying their own bodies and could later return to their own bodies. This form of transfer was sometimes known simply as *possession* and considered a different skill. 
## Living vessels
Some [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] are particularly suited to act as vessels for [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force ghost\|Force ghosts]] or other spirits, including living spirits, and are more likely to both survive the transfer or possession and to do so without suffering physical consequences.
