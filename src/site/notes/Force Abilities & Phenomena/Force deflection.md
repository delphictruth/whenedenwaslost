# Force deflection
Force deflection is the ability of a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-user]] to deflect energy-based attacks like blaster bolts and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Lightning\|Force Lightning]] with their bare hands. It is usually practiced when the user is without a lightsaber or chooses not to carry one, causing some refer to it as an "empty handed" or "bare handed" form of combat. Some practitioners are able to deflect physical melee attacks through the Force, such as those performed with a lightsaber, or direct the deflection back towards their opponents.
