# Alter Environment
Alter Environment utilizes innate life energy to manipulate temperatures, creating sub-zero temperatures in seconds or blistering heat that can burn. With this ability, a user can generate electrical discharges over broad expanses of ground, vacate areas of air, or increase the pressure of the air to burst eardrums. The power allows a Force-user to form small earthquakes and fissures or gather the moisture in the air to bring about flash floods. 

Moreover, Alter Environment can influence existing natural occurrences. For instance, a thunderstorm can be manipulated to unleash a burst of lightning, or rain clouds to start up torrential rains or hail. Windswept seas can be coaxed to rear up in massive waves or form whirlpools. 

[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Wind\|Force Whirlwind]] and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Pyrokinesis\|Pyrokinesis]] are considered specialized forms of Alter Environment.
