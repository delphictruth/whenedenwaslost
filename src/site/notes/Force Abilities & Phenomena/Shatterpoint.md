# Shatterpoint
Shatterpoints are a complex Force phenomenon, perceivable only by an unknown innate talent or immense focus and concentration on the part of a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-user]]. Philosophers theorize that the ability to perceive these shatterpoints (an ability typically called *Shatterpoint*) is connected to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Precognition\|Precognition]] and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|Psychometry]]. Shatterpoints are akin to fault lines, similar to different pathways of actions. Adept Force users are able to perceive these faults through the Force and influence them.

In relation to events, a single "strike," or action, can cause events to transpire completely differently than they otherwise might. Shatterpoint users will perceive these strikes and be able to take advantage of them to alter the flow of events. 

Shatterpoints can also be detected in living beings, highlighting weak points in the target's physiologyâ€”especially those that arise from former injuries. A practitioner might perceive the existence of the old wounds and re-open them (or, in extreme cases, revert the injury back to its old state by re-breaking bones or recalling fractures). 

When applied to physical items, shatterpoints works much in the same manner. An individual can view an item through the Force, noting where it comes together and the weak points in its composition. By allowing the Force to surge through them into the weak point, individuals can effectively "shatter" the object, causing it to break into multiple fragments.
