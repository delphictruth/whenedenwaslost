# Force drain
Force drain refers to a spectrum of offensive and defensive Force powers predominately practiced by Dark side [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]]. These powers were used to tap into the strengths of an organic target and drain it, often redirecting it to the user. These abilities used connections to the target to draw upon, feed upon, and completely drain the wills and strengths of others. 

Although these abilities have some similarity to other abilities, such as [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Tutaminis\|tutaminis]] techniques and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force healing\|Force healing]], Force drain abilities are generally considered distinct due to their harmful effect on targets and Dark side alliance. 

Some experts are able to drain life and Force energy simultaneously, combining the two abilities and completely crippling a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] opponent. It is said that [[Characters/Revan\|Revan]] recorded his experience of being subjected to their technique and later mastering it himself in his [[Library/Holocrons/Holocron of Darth Revan\|Holocron]].

According to some historians, certain emotional connections to targets can prevent a user from draining the target or else weakened the effect. [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Darth Sidious]] recounted that it was difficult for weaker practitioners to Force drain close family members. 

*"It is a technique that is almost as old as the Sith themselves... It is a means of severing connections between life, the Force, and feeding upon the death it causes. It cannot be taught... it can only be gained through instinct, through experiencing its effects, first-hand."* â€” Jedi Master [[Characters/Darth Traya\|Kreia]]

## Drain life (Dark healing)
The ability *Drain life*, sometimes referred to as *Dark healing*, siphoned the vitality of an opponent to offer an equivalent effect of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force healing\|Force healing]]. Because Dark healing relies on draining the targets, it is considered a harmful version of Force healing and typically distinguished as a separate ability entirely. 
## Drain Force
*Drain Force* was used to offensively drain the Force energy from opponents and use that energy to rekindle the user's own Force energy and strength. This ability could also be used to temporarily restrict the target's Force energy or cut them off from the Force, dampening their connections for a time being. 
## Force Diminish
Another application, *Force Diminish*, is a power that enables the user to cause damage to an opponent's health and vitality through the Force. The user will slowly siphon away energy, to the extent of causing physical injury or physical decay of the body. 
## Deadly field (death field)
Some practitioners were about to create a *deathly field* of pure Dark side energy around themselves that would instantly wither away anyone who is caught in its radius. Targets would have their energy drained rapidly and completely, causing death within moments and often disintegrating the body. However, this ability is extremely exhausting and highly impractical to use for any extended period of time or against too many opponents.
