# Battle Meditation
Battle meditation is a Force ability that considerably boosts the morale, stamina, and overall battle prowess of an individual's allies while simultaneously reducing the opposition's combat-effectiveness by eroding their will to fight.

While [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force meld\|Force meld]] is considered a refinement of Battle Meditation, in reality Battle Meditation is the broader and more expansive technique. It allows the user to connect with the entire battle-field, to either bolster their own forces or to paralyze the enemy. Skilled practioners can link themselves to other Force-users to extend their reach, and eventually influence whole armies. 

The Sith also use their own variant, referring to it as either *Sith battle coordination* or *Sith battle meditation*. It is less powerful used by a Dark-sider, potentially because of the vaguely empathetic link that must form between user and their own allies.
