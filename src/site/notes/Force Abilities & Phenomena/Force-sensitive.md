# Force-sensitive
Force-sensitivity is generally a naturally occurring phenomena among some individuals. It refers to the ability to sense and potentially interact with the Force, which may range from incredibly low-grade sensitivity to extremely powerful connections. Latent Force-sensitives might never become aware of their abilities, or even if they do, they might not be able to fully Awaken or ever develop a stronger connection. Nevertheless, they may still have some unusual abilities (namely, the ability to sense others and intentions). 

While Force-sensitive is a general term for any who can sense the Force, the term *Force-user* is typically reserved for those who are then trained in the Force and are capable of actually wielding it. Most Force-users are formally trained, such as by the Jedi or Sith, but some develop the ability on their own with practice. *Force Adept* is also used mostly for those with some form of training, and specifically formal training.
