# Fallout
Although not necessarily what one might call a Force power, Fallout is a phenomena of the Force that occurs in Force-sensitives. It is a sort of defensive mechanism in response to extreme trauma, wherein the Force might shield the victim by hiding or altering the memories. 

It is not all that uncommon among Force-sensitives, and may occur in less severe situations and with less intensity. It is particularly common among those who have had a violent or traumatic Awakening; for example, [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Bastille Aurelius]] experienced flashburn related to his Awakening. 

[[Characters/Roman Ange\|Roman Ange]] and [[Characters/Versailles Cordelia\|Versailles Cordelia]] both suffer from Fallout related to the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]] and to some of the trauma of their childhoods. Roman experiences it more severely, and it is believed that the Fallout was part of why he was so vulnerable to the Dark side and able to summon a Sith ghost.
