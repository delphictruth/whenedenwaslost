# Awakening

An Awakening refers to the instant in which a latent [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] suddenly becomes actively aware of their abilities. It is not unusual for Force-sentitive children who go undetected by the Jedi to not realize their potential, and frequently they do by mere happenstance. Similarly, those with low grade Force sensitivity may remain latent for their entire lives, absent an Awakening. 

Some consider an Awakening to be a given at certain levels of Force sensitivity. Most who have a strong enough connection with the Force to be trained eventually do have one, and typically at relatively young ages. Jedi Master [[Characters/Rathos Visio\|Rathos Visio]] spoke of it as such, claiming that the Force cannot forever be "contained" within a Force-sensitive if they indeed have a strong enough connection to feel it. 

Another theory, and one that does not necessarily discredit the first, is that Awakenings can be triggered by external events. Even those with low grade sensitivity, if they experience such an event, may find themselves newly Awakened to their abilities or even with enhanced sensitivity. The threshold, in this case, is simply much lower for a Force-sensitive with a stronger connection; it is easier to trigger their Awakenings, because the Force lingers on the "surface" of their beings. 

The trigger theory has been largely accepted on some level by Jedi philosophers. Many Force-sensitives come into their power suddenly and violently, with abrupt Awakenings being triggered by traumatic or emotional events. It appears that an Awakening may be a given for those with stronger connections, but that it can be triggered *sooner*; like-wise, a Force-sensitive with a strong connection who is not triggered into an Awakening will often nonetheless have one naturally and less violently. 

Awakenings are known to set off a ripple effect in the Force. While this is often in connection with a burst of natural energy — the by-product of the triggering event at its core — it is also theorized that newly Awakened adepts temporarily put out a stronger signature, almost a beacon of awareness for Force-sensitives nearby. Some can be sensed from systems away. 

### Recorded Awakenings
