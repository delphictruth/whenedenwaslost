# Telepathy
Telepathy is the very basic ability to read and interact with other minds, mentally communicate, and project the user's thoughts over small or vast distances with other individuals. 

The [[Species & Cultures/Chiss\|Chiss]] refer to this ability as *Second Sight*.

Every Force-user is potentially able to use this ability. The range of telepathy itself is theoretically infinite, but the telepath must be able to sense the presences of those they wish to contact. Thus, communicating with non-Force-sensitives becomes nearly impossible over greater distances, while the range to contact other Force-sensitives was a bit further. 

Individuals who either share a biological relationship or a particularly strong emotional bond may be known to communicate across far greater ranges. In extreme cases (such as a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Bond\|Force Bond]]), the link apparently has no spacial limit.
