# Hibernation trance
The hibernation trance is an ability used by [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] to go into a very deep hibernation state, used to slowed the practitioner's metabolism and breathing to a standstill. This cause the individual to only use one tenth of the air of a normal individual, which can preserve their life or enable more effective healing, and makes the individual appear dead. In a deep enough trance, even other [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitives]] might not be able to sense the user's life signature through the Force.

## Palawa hibernation trance
The [[Force Traditions & Sects/Followers of Palawa\|Followers of Palawa]] created a certain type of *deep trance technique* that permitted practitioners to enter into a hibernation trance and sleep for decades without aging. It was also practiced by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Legions of Lettow\|Legions of Lettow]]. This is an early form of hibernation trance that was studied by later [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] to perfect the modern hibernation trance.
