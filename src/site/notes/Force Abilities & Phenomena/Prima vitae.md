# Prima vitae
*Prima vitae* (literally "Life Detection" in High Galactic) refers to the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]]-based Force ability that allows a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] to feel the presence of living things or beings and detect their positions at long and short range. This is a very basic form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense\|Force sense]], limited to the physical presence of living being and life signatures.
