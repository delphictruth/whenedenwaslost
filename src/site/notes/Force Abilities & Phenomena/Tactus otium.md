# Tactus otium
*Tactus otium* (literally "Sense Force" in High Galactic) is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]]-based Force power that allows the individual to sense the ambient Force in a given area. It can not be used to detect sentient beings, but allows the user to sense the magnitude of Force in an area or object and the alignment of that Force energy.
