# Force rend
Force rend is an application of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Pull\|Force Pull]] and one of the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|telekinetic]] abilities. It is largely considered a Dark side power, given its violent nature. A user will pull a target (object or living being) in two different directions simultaneously, tearing the target apart. More skilled users can tear an individual apart entirely, while others may only damage a person or only be able to destroy smaller objects.
