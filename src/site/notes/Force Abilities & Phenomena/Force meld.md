# Force meld
Force meld, otherwise known as a *battle meld*, is a technique where a number of Force users join their minds together through the Force, drawing strength from each other. 

A refinement of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Meditation\|Battle Meditation]]. While battle meditation can influence both the Force-sensitives and the insensitives of both sides, Force Meld concentrates on coordinating and improving the Force-sensitives of the user's side.

There is often someone acting as the core of the meld, who unites everyone through their connections to them. This also makes it alike [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Meditation\|Battle Meditation]], which is a much broader power.

### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*
The [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] are bound together through a Force meld, with [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Ani Ren]] acting as the center point of their bond. It is first mentioned in **Book III** and is notably weakened after Ani's fight with [[Characters/Hazel Caelum\|Hazel Caelum]] in **Book XIII**, later restored to ordinary strength after Ani recovers. [[Characters/Versailles Cordelia\|Versailles Cordelia]] reflects on the fact that the meld is strengthened when they are off of war-footing, with their "true" selves being able to connect through the bond.
