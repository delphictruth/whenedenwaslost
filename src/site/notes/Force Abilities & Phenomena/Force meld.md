# Force meld
Force meld, otherwise known as a *battle meld*, is a technique where a number of Force users join their minds together through the Force, drawing strength from each other. 

A refinement of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Meditation\|Battle Meditation]]. While battle meditation can influence both the Force-sensitives and the insensitives of both sides, Force Meld concentrates on coordinating and improving the Force-sensitives of the user's side.

There is often someone acting as the core of the meld, who unites everyone through their connections to them. This also makes it alike [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Meditation\|Battle Meditation]], which is a much broader power.
