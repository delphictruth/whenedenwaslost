# Animal bond
Animal bond is a Force power that allows the User to command and control animals. It can be limited to merely connecting with and calming animal, or be used to fully control an animal's actions or to "borrow" the animal's senses. Force users typically use the power as a latent skill to tame mounts or train guard beasts. As such, it was traditionally a skill taught to Younglings by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]].
