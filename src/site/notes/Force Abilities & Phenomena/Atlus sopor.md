# Atlus sopor
*Atlus supor* is the traditional term for the Force ability to increase a user's force on and connection with the Force. It is a basic area of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]] that, when practiced in the extreme, could allow the user to "merge" into the Force and become invisible to others (an ability more modernly known as *Force stealth*).

A mirror ability achieved through a meditation based on [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]] as opposed to Control is called [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense#Clear mind\|clear mind]].

## Force stealth
Also known as *Force Concealment* or *Buried Presence*, *Force stealth* is considered the height of the *atlus sopor* technique. A talented practitioner can hide mask their Force alignment (and appear neutral in the Force), their [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitivity]], or even their entire presence from other Force-sensitives. They essentially become "invisible" in the Force.
## Quey'tek meditation
*Quey'tek meditation* is a prevalent form of Force Concealment, through which a Sith Lord or Dark Jedi masks their own dark signature and appears as completely benevolent to even the most powerful and alert Jedi. While this ability is essentially the same as neutral Force Concealment, this terminology for it was used by the Sith.
