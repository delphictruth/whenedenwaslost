# Force storm
A Force storm is a weather phenomenon that consists of significant and violent weather patterns, with some occasionally accompanied by volcanic or seismic activities. These storms are generally "naturally" occurring within the Force, triggered by powerful presences or events as opposed to by a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-user]]'s manipulations, but they can be intentionally made or manipulated in some cases. [[Navigational/Planets/Tython\|Tython]] is rather infamously ravaged by Force storms. 

For this reason, practitioners of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Alter Environment\|Alter Environment]] are said to "create" Force storms that take on a will of their own (not to be confused with the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Lightning\|Force Lightning]] ability [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Lightning#Force Storm (Summon Storm)\|Force Storm]], where the "storm" generated is entirely dependent on the practitioner and will dissolve without prolonged maintenance).
