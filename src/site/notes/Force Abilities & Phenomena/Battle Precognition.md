# Battle Precognition
Battle precognition is a variant of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Precognition\|Precognition]], with a more narrow focus to combat. It allows the user to sense and foretell the flows of the Force while engaged in battle. 

Some refer to it as *Blink*, given the way that a user might foresee and react to shifting intentions in combat in the blink of an eye. Particularly powerful visions might leave a sort of after-image in the user's vision.
