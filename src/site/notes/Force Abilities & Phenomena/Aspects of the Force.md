# Aspects of the Force
According to the teachings of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], there are three aspects of the Force that govern all abilities and powers accessible through the Force: [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]], [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Sense\|Sense]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Alter\|Alter]].
## Control
Control is traditionally the first aspect of the Force that Jedi Initiates studied. The discipline of Control centers around three main abilities: *[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Tutaminis\|tutaminis]]* (energy absorption), *[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force healing\|curato salva]]* (self-healing), and *[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Atlus sopor\|atlus sopor]]* (heightened focus).

## Sense 
The Sense discipline was typically taught as the second aspect of the Force, used to broaden the scope of their Control abilities. These abilities allow the user to immerse themselves in their environment and use the Force as an additional sense. Sense abilities were traditionally divided into four main groups: *[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Prima vitae\|prima vitae]]* (life detection), *[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Tactus otium\|tactus otium]]* (sense Force), *[[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Psychometry\|tai vordrax]]* (postcognition), and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telepathy\|projected telepathy]].

## Alter
Alter is the third and most difficult aspect of the Force taught by the Jedi. The Alter discipline focuses on manipulating objects, influencing other beings, and affecting the environment. Such abilities were carefully practiced and honed, but many of these abilities are the sort that [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitives]] discover accidentally or innately. The three fundamental Alter techniques taught to all Jedi Padawans were [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|Telekinesis]], [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Tricks\|Affect mind]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Alter Environment\|Alter Environment]].
