# Force ghost
A Force ghost is the soul and essence of a deceased [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] who denied the will of the Force upon death or otherwise acted to preserve their identity after death. The ability to become a Force ghost is considered a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Control\|Control]]-based Force power, though ghosts are sometimes formed naturally or through mysterious circumstances. Force ghosts exist with varying degrees of power and physicality, with some existing only as an "echo" or impression in the Force and others being able to manifest and physically interact with living beings. 

Some Force ghosts are capable of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Spirit Transference\|Spirit Transference]], through which a Force ghost transfers their consciousness into living body or inanimate object and essentially possessed their target.
