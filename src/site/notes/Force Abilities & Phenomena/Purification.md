# Purification
Purification refers to the application of powerful Light side energy to "heal" the effects of the Dark side and reverse Dark side corruption. Although it is most commonly applied in the context of healing [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Bleed\|bled]] [[Crystals/Lightsaber crystals\|kyber crystals]], in rare instances Purification can also be used to heal individuals who have become corrupted by the Dark side or heal wounds inflicted through Dark energy. 

When a kyber crystal is Purified, the crystal's color will change once more. Sometimes the crystal will revert to its original color or a paler version of its original color, but usually it will turn white. Very rarely the crystal will turn another color entirely, seemingly according to the Force's will. 

Some Jedi philosophers have theorized that an incredibly powerful Purification could heal a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Wound in the Force\|Wound in the Force]].
