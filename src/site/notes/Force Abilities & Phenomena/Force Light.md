# Force Light
Force Light is an [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Aspects of the Force#Alter\|Alter]]-based Force power generally employed by the Jedi. When used against a darksider, Force Light weakens the darksider's connection to the Force. 

The practitioner can either purge or contain dark side manifestations or nexus points, whether in places, spirits, or even living persons, though sometimes to detrimental effect. By channeling the Force into withering blasts of light-side energy, the darkness can then be diminished or destroyed permanently. 

Force Light can also be used to sever the ritualistic bond formed between a [[Library/Speculations on Tactics of the Sith\|Sith battlelord]] and his or her followers. However, powerful darksiders can resist it or even deflect it back at a Jedi.
