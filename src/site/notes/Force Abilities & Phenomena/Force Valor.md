# Force Valor
Force Valor is a Light side Force power that increases the resolve, accuracy, and speed of the user by tapping into the force. By increasing the rate at which one's capacities functioned, a Jedi can allow their body to move and react quicker, leap higher and farther, strike more powerfully, and fight with improved accuracy. 

This ability is extremely similar to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Body\|Force Body]], distinguished by the fact that Force Valor is exclusively powered by Light side energy and does not push the user's body beyond their capabilities. It is therefore a weaker but less risky ability. Force Valor is commonly chosen to be enhanced by [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Enlightenment\|Force Enlightenment]].
