- Also known as *Force Lift*, *Levitation*
# Telekinesis
Telekinesis is the neutral ability that most [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitives]] are capable of, at least on a basic level, with or without training. It is one of the most common early manifestations of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitivity]] and typically comes naturally to users. Telekinesis covers a wide range of techniques, with many unique combinations and uses, but the three primary or major techniques are the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Push (Force Shove)\|Force Push]], [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Pull (Force Tug)\|Force Pull]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Grip\|Force Grip]]. In its most basic form, Telekinesis is known as *Levitation* and involves lifting objects with the Force. 
## Force Push (Force Shove)
The *Force Push* is the most basic application of Telekinesis, in which the user pushes objects or beings away with a physical manifestation of the Force. Varying degrees of power can be used, with stronger Pushes requiring greater energy and exertion by the user. Derivatives of the Force Push include the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Wave\|Force Wave]] (including *Force Shockwave*), [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Blast\|Force Blast]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Wind\|Force Wind]] (including *Force Whirlwind*). 
### Force Throw
The *Force Throw* is commonly considered the same as or merely a more powerful version of the *Force Push*, though it relies on a simultaneous application of *Force Grip* as well and is therefore slightly distinct. A user will take ahold of an object or individual with the Force and hurl it towards a target with astounding velocity. 
## Force Pull (Force Tug)
The *Force Pull* involves using the Force to draw an object or being closer to the user. The stronger the user, the heavier the object they can pull and the further they can pull it from. Practitioners routinely use the Force Pull to disarm opponents, pull them forward into attacks, pull opponents or allies across open chasms to the other side, or even (at higher levels) pull an entire ship out of the sky. Derivatives of the Force Pull include [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force rend\|Force rend]]. 
## Force Grip
The *Force Grip* is a highly versatile and adaptable use of Telekinesis that enables a practitioner to physically grip a target and exert more control over the target than mere levitation allows. It is often uses to restrain or immobilize opponents, lift and hold targets in the air, control target's movements, or take ahold of a target before applying another Force ability to them. With enough force, it can be used to grip specific parts — such as bones or organs on an individual — and apply enough force to crush them. 
### Force Choke
The *Force Choke* is a purely offensive technique used to grip or squeeze a living being's throat or airways in order to cut off their oxygen or strangle them. With enough force, the Force Choke can be used to break an opponent's neck and vertebrae.
