# Crucitorn
Crucitorn is a [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|lightsaber combat]] technique for decreasing physical pain or transcending it beyond normal thresholds using the Force. It is essentially the ability to control an opponent's (or ally's) experience of pain. It has been used by both the Jedi and the Sith.

Users use mental infiltration to focus on another's sensation or interpretation of pain, enhancing it to seem as if an injury is more painful than it really is or alleviating the amount of pain experienced. For this reason, it is sometimes considered a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Tricks\|mind trick]].

Another method of using Crucitorn is to use the Force to physically agitate individual wounds, thus causing more pain than there would be if the wounds were left alone.
