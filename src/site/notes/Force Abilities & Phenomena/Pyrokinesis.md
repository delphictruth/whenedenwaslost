- Also known as *fire manipulation*
# Pyrokinesis
Pyrokinesis is a Force power that allows the user to manipulate and generate fire. Typically, users will conjure flames from already existing material or take control of already existing flames, but some users are capable of conjuring flames from the air in a specialized form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Alter Environment\|Alter Environment]]. 

It is relatively easy for [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] to direct and control an existing flame, but more refined control or uses can be difficult to accomplishâ€”particularly with larger and more unruly fires. 

**Specialists**::
- [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Bastille Aurelius]]
### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*
