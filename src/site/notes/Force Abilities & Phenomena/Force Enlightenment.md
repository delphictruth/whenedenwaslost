- Also known as 
# Force Enlightenment 
When activated, this power takes the Force powers a Jedi is most skilled in, pushing them to the highest degree that the Jedi has mastered during his or her routine training. 

Typically, Enlightenment will be used on [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force speed\|Force speed]], [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Shield\|Force Shield]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Valor\|Force Valor]]. The end result is an "enlightened" Jedi.
