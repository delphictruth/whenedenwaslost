# Force Enlightenment 
Force Enlightenment is a passive Light side Force power that allows a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-user]] to push themselves beyond their natural abilities. When activated, this power takes the Force powers a Jedi is most skilled in, pushing them to the highest degree that the Jedi has previously mastered during his or her routine training. 

Typically, Enlightenment will be used on [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force speed\|Force speed]], [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Shield\|Force Shield]], and [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Valor\|Force Valor]]. The end result is an "enlightened" Jedi, having fully harnessed their ability in that technique. This technique is achieved through the prolonged study of the Force.
