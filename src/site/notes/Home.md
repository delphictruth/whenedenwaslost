<center>be like the love that discovered the sin<br>
that freed the first man and will do so again<br>
be that hopeful feeling <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334440/chapters/45992584">when eden was lost</a><br>
it's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed<br>
which side of the wall really suffers that cost?<br>
oh, lover, be good to me</center>
