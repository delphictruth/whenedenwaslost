# Chelidae species

Chelidae are a sentient species indigneous to the planet [[Navigational/Planets/Castilon\|Castilon]]. They are amphibious but prefer to live about the water, on the small islands on Castilon. They are generally a bit smaller than humans but bipedal and vaguely humanoid in nature. They have protective shells on their backs, like turtles, and green or brown skin.
