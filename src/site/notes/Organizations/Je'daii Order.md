# Je'daii Order

*"In the light, there is darkness and in the darkness, a light. It is the way with us all. Be a prisoner of neither Bogan nor Ashla. Strive to live in Balance. As Tython itself teaches us, it is dangerous to do otherwise. And the danger is there—always."* — Je'daii Temple Master Ketu

The Je'daii Order was an ancient organization unified by its belief and observance of the Force on the planet [[Navigational/Tython\|Tython]], formed from the philosophies of several organizations studying the Force at the time and notably influenced by the [[Organizations/Order of Dai Bendu\|Order of Dai Bendu]]. Even the name *Je'daii* is derived from the [[Organizations/Order of Dai Bendu\|Order of Dai Bendu]]; it is an amalgam of two Dai Bendu words: je ("mystic") and dai ("center").

The Je'daii were dedicated to maintaining Balance, seeing the Force as three aspects of a whole: The Ashla (Light), the Bogan (Dark), and the Bendu (Balance). They believed that Tython naturally represented this duality, as it had two natural moons: one bathed in light (called *Ashla*) and one shroaded in darkness (called *Bogan*). Je'daii who fell too far to either aspect of the Force were exiled to the respective moon to meditate on the opposite until they returned to balance. 

The Je'daii philosophy acknowledged that there is always a light within darkness, and a darkness within light, such that it is impossible for one to ever be truly free of either. Je'daii were encouraged to give into the tempations of both the light and the dark, because it was necessary to embrace both in order to learn more of the Force and to achieve Balance. 

The Je'daii maintained nine Temples, each of which was presided over by a Je'daii Temple Master. The nine Temple Masters formed the Council of Masters. Mastery was accomplished by studying different tenants of the Force at each of the Temples. There were also Je'daii Journeyers (those who have finished Padawan training and were current;y traveling between Temples for the [[Library/Great Journey\|Great Journey]]) and Je'daii Rangers (those who have finished their training at the Temples and acted as representatives of the Je'daii).

## Je'daii Oath

*There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no fear, there is power.
