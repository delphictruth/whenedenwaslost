# Black Knights
The Black Knights were an alliance of [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith]] cultists organized on [[Navigational/Planets/Malrev IV\|Malrev IV]] under the authority of a Sith Lord known only as the *Dark Underlord*. The Knights were active during the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]] and although they were defeated swiftly, they reformed and rose up again several times over the following centuries. They legacy is primary recognized in the fact that Sith Lords are occasionally referred to as "dark knights," though this terminology is fairly obscure and not well recorded.
