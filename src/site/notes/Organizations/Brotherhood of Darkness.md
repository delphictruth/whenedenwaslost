# Brotherhood of Darkness
The Brotherhood of Darkness was a group of Sith that rose to power in the last decade of the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]] during the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]] era. It was formed out of the remnants of the [[Organizations/New Sith Empire\|New Sith Empire]], though some historians record it as one of the many factions contained within the New Sith. It was led by the Jedi Master turned Dark Lord [[Characters/Skere Kaan\|Skere Kaan]] and gained control over the remains of the Sith by force. 

The Brotherhood of Darkness waged war against the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]] and the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]'s [[Organizations/Army of Light\|Army of Light]].
