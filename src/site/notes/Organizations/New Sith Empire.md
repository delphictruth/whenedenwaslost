# New Sith Empire
The name "New Sith Empire" is something of an archival inventions by historians; it refers to a series of factions of the [[Sith Order\|Sith Order]] that existed throughout the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]] era and tried to restore a "new" [[Sith Empire\|Sith Empire]]. As many of the smaller and less significant factions went unrecorded or forgotten, historians have referred to them as a collective group â€” and they more or less did act as such, largely following the rule of several influential leaders.

[[Characters/Darth Ruin\|Darth Ruin]] created the first faction and is considered the first Dark Lord of the New Sith Empire, leading the Sith in the war against the [[Organizations/Old Republic\|Old Republic]] and [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]]. The [[Organizations/Black Knights\|Black Knights]] are sometimes recognized as a faction of the New Sith Empire, while the [[Organizations/Battlelords\|Battlelords]] under [[Characters/Darth Rivan\|Darth Rivan]] are standardly recognized as such. 

While the New Sith Empire succeeded in almost entirely defeating the Republic and Order by the conclusion of the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]], it was weakened itself when the Sith ranks dissolved into in-fighting and civil war. Treachery and perpetual turmoil eventually led to the total collapse of the New Sith, but in 1010 BBY the New Sith were "reformed" as the [[Organizations/Brotherhood of Darkness\|Brotherhood of Darkness]]. 

The Brotherhood would go on to be defeated in 1000 BBY, concluding the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]], so the New Sith's legacy was relatively short-lived following its collapse.
