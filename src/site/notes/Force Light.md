# Force Light
When used against a darksider, Force Light weakens the darksider's connection to the Force. 

The practicitioner can either purge or contain dark side manifestations or nexus points, whether in places, spirits, or even living persons, though sometimes to detrimental effect. By channeling the Force into withering blasts of light-side energy, the darkness can then be diminished or destroyed permanently. 

Force Light can also be used to sever the [[Bond|Bond]] between a Sith battlelord and his or her followers. However, powerful dark siders can resist it or even deflect it back at a Jedi.
