# Song of Lojuun
The *Song of Lojuun* is a musical piece from an opera written by the [[Bith species\|Bith species]]. The opera told the story of a Jedi Knight who returned from traveling the stars to save his people. However, the song was banned by the [[Organizations/Galactic Empire\|Galactic Empire]] for its inclusion of the Jedi, with seemingly all records of the song and its story destroyed. 
### Appearances in *When Eden Was Lost*
In **Book XII**, [[Characters/Versailles Cordelia\|Victa Ren]] is heard singing the *Song of Lojuun*. Fragments of the lyrics, as she sings them:

*...rush home, dear Lojuun, for the stars are closing in...
...sweet Lojuun, do they slip between your fingers?
Sweet Lojuun, are the stars not what you expected? 
Do you understand that it will never be the same, my dear Lojuun?
Dear Lojuun, do you understand that it will never be the same?*
