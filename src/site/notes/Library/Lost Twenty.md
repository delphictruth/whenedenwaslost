# Lost Twenty
The Lost Twenty are the "only" Jedi Masters to ever voluntarily resign from the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], typically over ideological differences. It is thus extremely rare for Jedi Masters to leave the Order under such conditions, and they have historically parted from the Order amicably and been commemorated as one of *The Lost*.

Although some fallen Jedi turned Sith Lords have claimed to be additions to the Lost Twenty, they either had not reached the rank of Master or were dismissed from the Order and therefore are not counted. 

Some refer to [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]] as the Twenty-First, but the fact that the [[Force Traditions & Sects/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]] had already collapsed by the time she disappeared makes this determination subject to debate. Notably, Jedi Master [[Characters/Darth Ruin\|Phanius]] was the First of the Lost Twenty, though he later revealed himself as the Sith [[Characters/Darth Ruin\|Darth Ruin]].

Some time before 22 BBY, in the final days leading to the [[Events/Clone Wars\|Clone Wars]], the Lost Twenty were commemorated by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] through a series of sculptural portrait heads, one for each member. These busts were originally located in the [[Library/Jedi Archives\|Jedi Archives]] in the Jedi Temple on [[Navigational/Planets/Coruscant\|Coruscant]], prior to the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Order\|Fall of the Jedi Order]], and were subsequently damaged during the Fall (with some smashed entirely).
