# Shah-tezh
Shah-tezh is an abstract strategy game for two players, each beginning with an identical contingent of pieces that are moved on a board called the "demesne." The objective is to place an opponent's most important piece, the Imperator, under an attack from which it can not escape, thus ending the game. Over the course of history, it spawned many variants, including Dejarik, holochex, and holochess.

*"Each piece exists in service to one other piece—the Imperator. All the pieces of the demesne are here to protect the Imperator. If the Imperator falls, the game is over. That is true no matter how many pieces remain on the board."* — [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Darth Sidious]] to Gallius Rex

Each player has nine pieces: the Imperator, the Beast, the Counselor, the Craft, the Disciple, the Dowager, the Knight, the Outcast, and the Vizier. As in the modern holochess, each piece has a certain move-set that makes its strategy unique. The Knight, for instance, can move in any direction up to 2 spaces, while the Vizier may only move in diagonal travel but for an unlimited number of spaces.
## Variants 
Shah-tezh in an ancient game, traditionally played with physical, wooden white and black pieces. Over the centuries many variants have evolved, some more popular than others. 
### Dejarik 
*Dejarik* is the variant that was most commonly played by the modern [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], later adapted and played widely by the Galaxy in the form of *holochess*. It is played with eight holographic pieces in the shape of real and mythological creatures, included the Ghhhk, Grimtaash, Molator, Houjix, Kintan strider, K'lor'slug,  Mantellian Savrip, Monnok, Ng'ok, Bulbous, Scrimp, and karkath.

Each turn, a player may choose one of three options: attack only; move and attack; or move and use a "special ability" (which varies according to the piece type). The player with the last remaining piece on the board wins. 

Another form of Dejarik is *Saigok*, which varied somewhat in its format and was developed by the same creator of Dejarik. It is a more "intense" form of the game.
### Holochess
The most modern of variants is *holochess*, which itself has several variations (*Mobeius chess*, *Denebian Holochess*, *Divoran Holochess*). It utilizes holograph pieces as opposed to the traditional wooden pieces, often in the form of exotic aliens as opposed to the standard nine pieces. The board is also circular instead of the square demesne. It is a popular gambling game.
### Holochex
Not to be confused with *holochess*, the *holochex* variant (popular on [[Navigational/Planets/Tatooine\|Tatooine]]) only has one type of piece and can be played on several different board layouts. Each player begins the game with twelve monster-shaped pieces of a certain color, the player's turn designated by the edge of the board glowing in accordance with that player's color. The game requires a player to capture their opponent's monsters while at the same time the opponent is trying to jump their pieces. 

Monsters can move in any straight or diagonal line, and are allowed to double jump. According to the rules, if a pawn is in a position to take the opponent's pawn, it has to do so. Whoever captures all the enemy pieces won the game. Most players well versed in the game find it difficult to come back from a loss if the opponent manages to capture a sizable number of pieces early in the game, as successful strategies often consist of strings of sacrifice moves and double jumping. Most boards are equipped with an electronic help buttons, showing novice players where moves and jumps can be made.
## Tactics
There are many tactics and strategies utilized in Shah-tezh, representing the extremely diverse play styles and approaches. Shah-tezh and its variants have commonly been used as political and military training and metaphors for that very reason. 

While not a formal strategy, one important tenant of Shah-tezh is the understanding that as the most important piece, the Imperator is not meant to be used for any front line attacks. 

*"Never send your Imperator in place of a Knight."* — [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]], explaining a strategy utilizing the Knight piece to get behind the opponent's front line

Nevertheless, there are some tactics that weaponize the Imperator in contradiction of this primary tenant. 

**Notable Dejarik tactics**::
* *Kintan strider death gambit*: A player sacrifices the kintan strider piece (an ordinarily devastating loss) in order to mask any even more devastating countermove. 
* *The fork*: A player moves one holomonster to threaten at least two of the opponent's, so that no matter what the opponent does one piece will be lost. It is a common mistake in play to leave oneself vulnerable to a fork. (The word fork in common [[Library/Galactic slang\|Galactic slang]] came to be used as a generic term for facing a choice between two disasters: "We are well and truly forked.")
* *K'lor'slug sacrifice*: A player uses a k'lor'slug piece to destroy an opponent's piece, sacrificing itself in the process.
