# Sayings
>The teaching's of Emperor Uueg Tching

The *Sayings* are a series of scrolls composing a collection of didactic and gnomic precepts of [[Navigational/Atrisia\|Atrisia]] Emperor Tching of the Kital Phard Dynasty. His wisdom regarding the strategic use of power, diplomacy, and espionage are admired throughout the whole galaxy, and serve as a point of national pride for [[Navigational/Atrisia\|Atrisia]]. 

A later emperor had the scrolls digitalized for mass production in public databases. Similarly, the Atrisian Parliament produced a limited printing of bound copies in a campaign effort, which are considered great treasures to this day. 

The original scrolls were briefly displayed in the [[Imperial Museum\|Imperial Museum]] on [[Navigational/Coruscant\|Coruscant]] at the [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Emperor]]'s request. They were never returned to [[Navigational/Atrisia\|Atrisia]], said to have disappeared into the [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Emperor]]'s personal vaults, and they have yet to be recovered even several years after his defeat. It is something of a mystery, where those original scrolls disapepared to.
