# Speculations on Tactics of the Sith
The *Speculations on Tactics of the Sith* was a Jedi publication detailing a study of the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]] tactic of creating battlelords, with a particular focus on the [[Organizations/Battlelords\|Battlelords]] that fought under [[Characters/Darth Rivan\|Darth Rivan]] during the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]]. 

The exact methods for Sith battlelords is supposedly recorded in *Speculations*, but attempts to replicate such methods were unsuccessful and the publication was later lost along with other Sith tomes when the [[Navigational/Jedi Archives\|Jedi Archives]] were seized. Information on the creation of battlelords was also inscribed on the walls of Sith temples and copied in *Speculations*.
## Sith battlelords
Battlelords were Sith warrior leaders who performed [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]] rituals to form bonds with their subordinates. The bond had a unique strengthening effect on the battlelords, bolstering their ferocity on the battlefield and granting them physically thicker skin for defense. Battlelords developed a maniacal blood-rage as a result of the bonding rituals and were known to push their troops to extreme lengths.

The battlelord ritual created a near-physical bond between the battlelords and their troops. Bonded soldiers who strayed too far from their battlelord would experience intense abdominal pain and a throbbing headache for hours, eventually dying unless they returned to close proximity of their battlelord. Additionally, the separation of any member from the rest of the regiment would cause the entire regiment to experience intense physical pain and experience hallucinations of their own destruction. This effect of the ritual nearly eliminated desertion among the Sith ranks. 

Additionally, bonded soldiers who tried to attack their battlelord would experience extreme pain and eventually die if they continued their assault. A battelord could not be physically injured by their subordinates: drawing the battlelord's blood would not affect them, as one of the bonded soldiers would receive the pain and lasting injury instead. This transfer of pain and injury could occasionally be triggered even when the battlelord is attacked by a non-bonded opponent, provided there is a bonded soldier close enough on the battlefield to receive the transfer. 

Battlelords could summon power from their bonded subordinates that are close by on the battlefield. Soldiers who are drained in this way would become dazed and disorientated and occasionally may die from the process. 

*Speculations* noted that killing a battlelord would release the soldiers bonded to the leader. It also detailed a method of severing the bond through an application of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force Light\|Force Light]]. 
## Darth Rivan's Battlelords
*Speculations* also contained a section detailing the history of the battelords and their origins with [[Characters/Darth Rivan\|Darth Rivan]]'s [[Organizations/Battlelords\|Battlelords]]. This section contained a background on the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]] and the downfall of the Battelords. For this reason, it has been referenced by military historians as well.
