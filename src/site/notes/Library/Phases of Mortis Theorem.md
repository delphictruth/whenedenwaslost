# Phases of Mortis Theorem

The *Unsolved Thorpe Theorem* is a hyperspace splotting conundrum created by Jedi Master Thorpe, contained within the [[Library/Ancient Jedi texts/Ancient Jedi texts\|ancient Jedi texts]]. It was a hypothetical posed to Jedi Padawans. Although the theorem is infamously "unsolved," a solution to it was later included within the texts as well, known as the Phases of Mortis. For this reason the theorem is more mordernly known as the *Phases of Mortis Theorem*.
