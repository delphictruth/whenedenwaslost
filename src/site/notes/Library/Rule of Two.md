# Rule of Two
The Rule of Two, a philosophical successor to the [[Doctrine of the Dyad\|Doctrine of the Dyad]], is a decree adopted by the Sith in order to preserve their secrecy and guard their secrets. It was developed following the chaos of the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]] and modeled on both the [[Doctrine of the Dyad\|Doctrine of the Dyad]] and the teachings contained within the [[Library/Holocrons/Holocron of Darth Revan\|Holocron of Darth Revan]]. 

*"Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody power, the other to crave it."* â€• Darth Bane

The Rule of Two states that there would be only two Sith at one time, a master and an apprentice, guaranteeing that when the apprentice becomes powerful enough in the ways of the dark side to take the title of master, only then would they be worthy of the title. This transfer of power would only take place when the apprentice takes their master's life and finds a worthy student to repeat the cycle, this way the Sith will grow more powerful and still exist through the new master. Both master and apprentice were considered to be Sith Lords.
