# Telos Holocron 

The Telos Holocron is an ancient holocron crafted by the Sith Order, meant to host all of their recorded knowledge of the Dark side of the Force. The information and teachings of many other holocrons were transferred to the Telos Holocron, and it was passed down through a series of Sith Lords and Dark side practioners known as *gatekeepers*.

The holocron contains testimonials from several of the gatekeepers themselves and from many Sith Lords who lived prior to the holocron's creation, including [[Characters/Revan\|Revan]], whose knowledge was transferred from an older holocron. 

The Telos Holocron was created by its first gatekeeper, [[Characters/Darth Grimm\|Darth Grimm]], during the Golden Age of the Sith. Its last recorded gatekeeper is [[Characters/Darth Sidious\|Darth Sidious]] and it went missing shortly after his defeat.
