# Tedryn Holocron

The Tedryn Holocron is a milky jade cube of standard design created over 4,000 years before the [[Events/Battle of Yavin\|Battle of Yavin]] and the start of the [[Directories/Timeline\|ABY]] calendar. Although initially created by Jedi Master Tedryn, its primary [[Library/Gatekeeper\|Gatekeeper]] later became Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas on account of Baas having contributed over five times the amount of information as Tedryn's original records. It was also kept by the Jedi Master Bodo Baas, Vodo-Siosk's descendent, who acts as a secondary gatekeeper as well. 

The Tedryn Holocron stores a vast amount of information from the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] and was once used to as an important tool for training padawans. It is very heavily Light-aligned and cannot be activated by most Darksiders; even those who do gain access often are not able to speak to some of the secondary gatekeepers or access any of the deeper levels of information.
