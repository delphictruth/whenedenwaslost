# Jedi Trials
In the old [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], the Jedi Trials were the challenges Jedi padawans were given as pre-requisites for achieving [[Library/Jedi Traditions/Knight Ceremony\|Knighthood]], and were sometimes retaken by Knights to earn the rank of Jedi Master. The primary trials are a set of five: the *Trial of Skill*, the *Trial of Courage*, the *Trial of the Flesh*, the *Trial of Spirit*, and the *Trial of Insight*. In addition, the Council sometimes assigned substitute tests or used an exceptionally trying mission in place of the traditional tests. 

Master Jedi [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]] taught the trials at the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum\|Jedi Praxeum]], but never formally required them of her students. Instead, Padawans in the [[Force Traditions & Sects/New Jedi Order\|New Jedi Order]] performed modified and shortened versions of the Jedi Trials, or else "passed" certain trials through events in their lives and training.
## Trial of Skill
The *Trial of Skill* is one of the oldest trials included in the Jedi Trials. While the test does consist of numerous displays of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Lightsaber combat\|lightsaber technique]], the main focus of the trial is the potential Knight's ability to avoid distraction through self-discipline. The standardized form of this trial included a three-part assessment with physical, mental, and combat challenges.

The standard **physical challenges** include a test of climbing, heights, endurance, escape, and leaping. 

The **mental challenges** which follow test skill with [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis\|levitation]], a second endurance test, duress, and reflection. 

The **combat challenges** require the student to face off against some form of adversary, whether living or simulated from archived data. These challenges test conflict, dueling, and the calm mind of the prospective Knight. Padawans could be expected to duel droids, other students, the Temple Battlemaster, the Grand Master, any number of opponents at once, Sith Lords produced through a simulacrum program, or any other such adversary. The student had to outlast their attacks, setting their stamina and abilities.
## Trial of Courage
The *Trial of Courage* is designed to measure a prospective Knight's courage and could be one of the more diverse trials in application. It is also one of the more secretive, with most Jedi choosing not to divulge the details of individual tests in order to keep future students in the dark about what they may face in this trial.

Originally, battlefield heroics or facing down a Sith Lord qualified as passing. However, in times of peace a different sort of challenge was developed for the Trial of Courage. Often the trial involves simulating a dangerous mission in the Trials Chamber or sending a student on an actual mission out of the Jedi Temple. These tests have the potential to be deadly and extremely challenging.
## Trial of the Flesh
The *Trial of the Flesh* was traditionally the most trying test given at the Temple. Involving the apprentice overcoming great physical pain, hardship, or loss, the trial sometimes resulted in death or dismemberment. Throughout history, the Trial was known to involve bloodshed of some form. 

At the height of the *Pius Dea Era*, the Order subjected its apprentices to burst of energy applied directly to the skin, known as *The Burning*. While this type of torture has long since been abandoned by the Order, battle scars can be accepted as passage. Historically, it wasn't that uncommon for Padawans who defeated a Lord of the Sith on the battlefield to pass the Trials of the Flesh, Skill, and Courage at the same time.
## Trial of the Spirit
To pass the *Trial of the Spirit*, apprentices have to look deep within their souls, on a quest of self-discovery. This trial is designed to pit a potential Knight against their most dangerous enemy: the Darkness within themselves. Because of this grueling self-examination, this trial is often known as *Facing the Mirror*. It is not uncommon that Padawans consider it a highly traumatic experience.

While bearing similarities to the *Trial of Skill*, this trial does not involve moving at all in most cases; instead a Padawan delves deep into a meditation trance to combat their inner fears and demons. Because of the dangers of such deep meditation, a Master was always present to help guide a student back after they pushed them past where they least desired to go in their thoughts. A failed trial could lead to awakening from meditation screaming and mentally broken, or even push a Padawan to the Dark side.
## Trial of Insight
The *Trial of Insight* is the last test offered as part of the Trials of Knighthood. This trial is designed to help a Jedi see what is really in front of their eyes through use of the Force. The trial focuses on seeing through illusion, evaluating an individual's true persona, and unveiling lies. 

The trial might require a Padawan to analyze and decipher the High Riddles of Dwartii, or decode broken text in scattered files. Sometimes, a field of stones is laid out on the Trials Chamber floor and a Padawan is be forced to locate the single grain of sand amongst it. To complete the trial, Padawans are forbidden from reviewing any of the possible puzzles in the Jedi Archives; such an advantage would make the test moot.
