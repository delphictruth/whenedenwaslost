# Rammahgon

Rammahgon is a well-known and influential work among the sacred Jedi texts, written in the Coremaic language by the Jedi writer Kli the Elder. It compiles many origin stories of the Jedi, including four different and conflicting origin stories for the cosmos and the Force itself. It also contains information on Sith wayfinders and diagrams of them, as well as some information of Sith strongholds (including [[Navigational/Exegol\|Exegol]]).

The front cover of the Rammahgon featured an "eye," which is referenced in the poem within called the *Fourth Precept*. The poem described gods fighting in a primeval universe.
