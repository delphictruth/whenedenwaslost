# Gray Jedi Code
The Gray Jedi Code was developed by Leor Danal to reflect the Gray Jedi philosophy. 

*"There must be both dark and light. I will do what I must to keep the balance, as the balance is what holds all life. There is no good without evil, but evil must not be allowed to flourish. There is passion, yet peace; serenity, yet emotion; chaos, yet order. I am a wielder of the flame; a champion of balance. I am a guardian of life. I am a Gray Jedi."* â€” Leor Danal, reciting what would be the basis for the Code for the first time while in a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Hibernation trance\|Force trance]]
## Code
_Flowing through all, there is balance_  
_There is no peace without a passion to create
There is no passion without peace to guide_
_Knowledge fades without the strength to act_
_Power blinds without the serenity to see_  
_There is freedom in life_
_There is purpose in death_  
_The Force is all things and I am the Force_
