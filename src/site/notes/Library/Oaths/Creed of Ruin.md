# Creed of Ruin
The Creed of Ruin was developed by former Jedi Master turned Sith Lord [[Characters/Darth Ruin\|Darth Ruin]], whose defection from the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]] eventually set off the centuries long [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]] era. 

## Creed

*There is no passion. There is solely obsession.
There is no knowledge. There is solely conviction.
There is no purpose. There is solely will.
There is nothing...
Only me.*
