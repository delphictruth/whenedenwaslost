# Code of the Sith
The Code of the Sith is the mantra that was used by the [[Sith Order\|Sith Order]] to reinforce core beliefs. It is considered the dark side counterpart to the [[Jedi Code\|Jedi Code]]. It was originally authored by the Jedi heretic *Sorzus Syn* and has been remarkably unchanged since its inception. 

In the Sith language, it is called *Qotsisajak*. There are two forms of the Code: one in the Sith language and one in Basic. 

*"A single, unifying code can be derived from the Sith philosophy. The Jedi have a code, and we exiles know it well. But we also know it is full of inadequacies and half-truths."* — Sorzus Syn, 6900 BBY

## Sith Code (Basic)

*Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
Through passion, I gain strength.
Through strength, I gain power.
Through power, I gain victory.
Through victory, my chains are broken.
The Force shall free me.*

## Qotsisajak ("Way of the Sith doctrine")

*Nwûl tash. 
Dzwol shâsotkun.
Shâsotjontû châtsatul nu tyûk.
Tyûkjontû châtsatul nu midwan.  
Midwanjontû châtsatul nu asha.  
Ashajontû kotswinot itsu nuyak.  
Wonoksh Qyâsik nun.*
