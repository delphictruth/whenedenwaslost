# Code of the Jedi
The Code of the Jedi reflects the philosophy taught by the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], modeled on the earlier [[Library/Oaths/Code of the Je'daii\|Code of the Je'daii]].

_There is no ignorance, there is knowledge._
_There is no passion, there is serenity._
_There is no chaos, there is harmony._
_There is no death, there is the Force._

_Emotion, yet peace._
_Ignorance, yet knowledge._
_Passion, yet serenity._
_Chaos, yet harmony._
_Death, yet the Force._
