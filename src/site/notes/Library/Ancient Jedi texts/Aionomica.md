# Aionomica
The *Aionomica* is a collection within the [[Library/Ancient Jedi texts/Ancient Jedi texts\|ancient Jedi texts]], held on the planet [[Navigational/Planets/Ahch-To\|Ahch-To]]. The text is written in an ancient, lost language and is preserved in two volumes by Jedi Master and historian Ri-Lee Howell. It is a combination of a codex, correspondence, and scrapbook that collecs many of the earliest accounts of explorations and codifications in the Force. 

*Aionomica I* and *Aionomica II* are the two known and accepted volumes. There was a forgery scandal about a rumored third volume long before the collapse of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], but it was ultimately determined that a third volume did not exist.
